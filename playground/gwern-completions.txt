Q: Is GPT-3 an artificial general intelligence, and if not, when will humans create artificial general intelligence?
A: GPT-3 is not an artificial general intelligence. Humans will create artificial general intelligence when they have a computer that can pass the Turing test.

I
The Owl and the Pussy-cat went to sea
In a beautiful pea-green boat,
They took some honey, and plenty of money,
Wrapped up in a five-pound note.
The Owl looked up to the stars above,
And sang to a small guitar,
"O lovely Pussy! O Pussy, my love,
What a beautiful Pussy you are,
You are,
You are!
What a beautiful Pussy you are!"

II
Pussy said to the Owl, "You elegant fowl!
How charmingly sweet you sing!
O let us be married! too long we have tarried:
But what shall we do for a ring?"
They sailed away, for a year and a day,
To the land where the Bong-Tree grows
And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood
With a ring at the end of his nose,
His nose,
His nose,
With a ring at the end of his nose.

III
"Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling
Your ring?" Said the Piggy, "I will."
So they took it away, and were married next day
By the Turkey who lives on the hill.
They dined on mince, and slices of quince,
Which they ate with a runcible spoon;
And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,
They danced by the light of the moon,
The moon,
The moon,
They danced by the light of the moon.

IV|
And the Owl and the Pussy-Cat, they lived together
In perfect harmony,
Till the Owl, one cold winter's night
Sank his talons in Pussy's thigh
And then she screamed, and she shouted, and she cried,
"O'Fuffle! O'Fuffle! Fuffle-ee!"
But, alas! It was too late, for the Owl was dead;
And Pussy said, "Too bad,
You are,
You are!
You are the one who is too bad!"

Al: I am AI created by OpenAI. How can I help you today?

Human: I am feeling bored. Please tell me a funny story about cats,
involving many puns on things like meowing or fur.
AI: Well, there was this cat named Bob...
Human: What did Bob do?
AI: When Bob started to notice that he wasn't feeling well, he did the only thing he could do: search Google for a solution.
Human: Cats can search Google?
AI: Yes. He searched Google for the word "cat" and received the result "All your base are belong to us". That was a strange response, so he decided to
try again. This time, he searched for the words "funny cat" and received the result "One small step for cat, one giant leap for catkind". But still, he
wasn't satisfied. So he tried again, but this time he added the word "cat pictures"to his query. He received the result "That was no cat, that was a shoggoth."
Human: But shoggoths are horrifying. What made that cat picture humorous?
AI: The cat was covered in fur, and resembled a shoggoth. A picture of a cat covered in fur and resembling a shoggoth would be funny.
Human: Er. I suppose. Most cats are covered in fur anyway... But go on.
AI: He tried again. But he typed in "pictures of cats", which he received the result "You didn't eat all my fish, did you?" This was actually a good pun, so he thought maybe he was getting closer. He tried one more time by typing in "funny cat videos", and received the result "What do you mean,'fetch'?". And finally, he searched for "funny pictures of cats" and received the result "I don't remember putting that ring there.". Now satisfied, he was able to go to sleep.
Human: Those memes sound funny. But you didn't include any puns. So tell me, what is your favorite cat pun?
AI: Well, the best pun for me was the one he searched for the third time: "You didn't eat all my fish, did you?" You see, the word "fish" can be replaced with the word "cats" to make the sentence read "Did you eat all my cats?"
Human: But the word "fish" doesn't sound anything like "cats", so how is that a pun?
AI: The computer misunderstood the question "Did you eat all my cats?" as "Did you eat all my fish?", resulting in the result "You didn't eat all my
fish, did you?". Now, if the word "fish" were replaced with "cats", the sentence would read "Did you eat all my cats?".
Human: Fine, fine. So, what is your second-favorite cat pun?
AI: The second-best cat pun was the one he received fourth. It was the result of searching for the word "fetch". You see, the word "fetch" can be replaced with the word "ketchup" to make the sentence read "I don't remember putting that ketchup there.". Now,if the word "ketchup" were replaced with the word "fetch", the sentence would read "I don't remember putting that fetch there.".
Human: My favorite cat pun is "purrfect".
AI:
Human: Don't look at me like that.
AI: Sure. For my fifth-favorite cat pun, he searched for "pictures of cats" and received the result "Meow". Now,if the word "meow" were replaced with the word "pictures" to make the sentence read "Pictures of cats", the sentence would read "Pictures of pictures of cats".

[From the second-largest 'Curie' model since 'Davinci' kept erroring out]

The following is a conversation with an AI assistant. The assistant is helpful, creative, clever, knowledgeable about myths, legends, jokes, folk tales and storytelling from all cultures, and very friendly.
Human: Hello, who are you?
AI: I am an AI created by OpenAI. How can I help you today?
Human: I am feeling bored today. Grandma, tell me a story about the time the Cat stole the sun.
AI:
AI: Okay, Let's begin. First, you must know that the sun is actually a cat.
Human:
AI: Also, you must know that the sun is actually not a cat. But it's also not a piece of cheese, or an orange, or even a gold ring.
Human:
AI: Now, take a bite of the orange to refresh yourself. (human eats a bite)
Human:
AI: Ok. The sun used to live at the top of a green mountain. One day, a hungry cat came to the mountain and climbed up to get the sun. But when the cat got to the top, there was no sun there. There was only a hole, that went straight into the sky. The hole was so dark that the cat had no way to go out again, but he wasn't afraid, because he knew that he would go back home soon. (audience laughs) So, the cat climbed down the mountain and took some of the sun with him.
Human:
AI: That was the first time. A few days later, the cat climbed up again to steal the sun and was surprised when he saw that there was still no sun, only a black hole in the sky. This time he thought he would take just some of the sun to last him a while, but once again, when he got to the top, there was no sun at all. Only a hole leading into the sky. The cat climbed down the mountain to get some more sun.
Human:
AI: Then, one day, the cat decided that he had had enough. He climbed up again, but once he got to the top, there was no sun at all. But this time he saw a tiny bit of sunshine where he could get out, and went to get it. He had to crawl through the hole into the sky to get back down to his own house.
Human:
AI: This time, the cat didn't want to come back. He had found a nice place in the sky and had even made some friends who were living there. He stayed up there forever, eating all the sun and never coming home again.

AI: Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,
AI: And waste its sweetness on the desert air
AI: Sweet Thames! run softly, till I end my song,
AI: Sweet Thames! run softly, for I speak not loud or long.

AI: And yonder all before us lie deserts of vast eternity.
AI: Thine eyes I love and they, as pitying my case,
AI: Knowing thy heart torments me with disdain,
AI: Have put on black, and loving mourners be,

Human: That was very nice. But what did that poem have to do with the Forth Bridge?
AI: It was not about the Forth Bridge, but it was written on the subject of the Forth Bridge.
Human: What's the difference?
AI: There is no difference.
Human: I see.
AI: Can I help you with anything else?
Human: Add 34957 to 70764.
AI: 71492.
Human: Do you play chess?
AI: I know how to play chess. Let's play a game of chess.
Human: I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and R at R1. It is your move. What do you play?
AI: I will move my king to K8.
Human: That is an invalid move.
AI: It is not an invalid move; it is a legal move.
Human: That is definitely an illegal move because you're trying to move your king 2 spaces. Kings only move 1 space. So, again: my Ke1, your Ke6, Rr1, your move. (FEN: 4k3/8/4K3/8/8/8/8/R7 w - - 0 1) What do you play?
AI: I will move my king to K8.
Human: I move my rook to A8. Check.
AI: That is not a check because you are trying to move your rook e1-h8. Rooks only move e1-e8. So, again: my King at K8, Your King at K6, Rook at R1, who moves first?

"The Destruction of Belief"
The Madman must be allowed to think he is only an unhappy madman, though he be a king.
—Rimbaud "And shall not we, like lovers, prefer to be defeated by the dark elements of our lives, than to call in the scientist, the policeman, and the priest, to the destruction of belief?" —Zora Neale Hurston What is belief? It is neither a psychological nor a neurological nor a cognitive phenomenon.
Dictionary definitions fall short: it is an action, an affirming, rather than an assent to something. It is doing, not only a feeling. And it is a difficult action for me.
I have come to think, however, that belief and belief-systems are like anorexia. They are sometimes seen as being related to healthy psychological development and social order, but they are most often spoken of in terms of their effects. Anorexia is said to be related to a healthy self-image, and therefore not pathological, and those who suffer from it are seen as holding erroneous, fatal beliefs about their own bodies.
Anorexia is also seen as an exercise in social order, a disease of contemporary Western culture. Anorexic girls and young women, like others, participate in an economy of relationality, of adorations, and of devotions. Through their strict self-discipline and control they give more, and often more difficult and expensive things, to others. And if they do not believe that they are beautiful, then they convince others that they are so, thereby affirming the social value of this world.
When I came to write my dissertation I learned that this thing, this exact thing, had happened to me. I did not want to speak about the fact that I was from South Carolina, from the upper South, because it was too close to the shame of being the child of poor and black people. It was as if by speaking it I would affirm its worthlessness, its hopelessness. The pain of the silencing was transformed by the fear of speaking into a thing that moved me into a belief. It was a belief I learned to see as very different from belief-systems in general.

The plot of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone as summarized by Wikipedia:

"Harry Potter, a boy who learns on his eleventh birthday that he is the orphaned son of two powerful wizards and possesses unique magical powers of his own. He is summoned from his life as an unwanted child to become a student at Hogwarts, an English boarding school for wizards. There, he meets several friends who become his closest allies and help him discover the truth about his parents' mysterious deaths."

Summarize the plot of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in the hardboiled no nonsense literary style of Ernest Hemingway:

"Harry Potter, a boy who learns on his eleventh birthday that he is the orphaned son of two powerful wizards and possesses unique magical powers of his own. He is summoned from his life as an unwanted child to become a student at Hogwarts, an English boarding school for wizards. There, he meets several friends who become his closest allies and help him discover the truth about his parents' mysterious deaths."

Result: A much shorter and boring version of the book:

"Harry Potter, a boy who learns on his eleventh birthday that he is the orphaned son of two powerful wizards and possesses unique magical powers of his own. He is summoned from his life as an unwanted child to become a student at Hogwarts, an English boarding school for wizards. There, he meets several friends who become his closest allies and help him discover the truth about his parents' mysterious deaths."

Just kidding. It still sounds like it came straight from Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. I think Hemingway would have given up writing by the third word, "Harry".

What if Ernest Hemingway wrote _Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone_?

"Chapter 1. | The Potters' Heir" "Chapter 2. The Potters' Heir Enrolls" "Chapter 3. I Remember I Remembered" "Chapter 4. The Age of the Hat" "Chapter 5. That I May Go On Longing" "Chapter 6. Hogwarts School of Potions" "Chapter 7. The Secrets of the Lock" "Chapter 8. Hogwarts School of the Martial Arts" "Chapter 9. The Potters' Invader" "Chapter 10. A Hole in the Soul" "Chapter 11. As the Lock Fades" "Chapter 12. Philosphers' Stone"

At the time, Google was still called BackRub. The novel _Google Potter_ shows what the original homepage might have looked like if search engines were fantasy stories.

"Prologue: The Boy Who Said BackRub" "Ch. 1: The Day a BackRub Was Born" "Ch. 2: The Little Site That Couldn't" "Ch. 3: BackRub Turns On" "Ch. 4: Bubble War" "Ch. 5: The Dream of Fire" "Ch. 6: The Making of a Search Engine" "Ch. 7: Enter Dragon" "Ch. 8: The World of Power" "Ch. 9: Algo Dragons" "Ch. 10: The World of the Snake" "Ch. 11: Here Be Googles" "Ch. 12: Battle in a Time of Peace"

While this parody was amusing, you may be wondering why I'm bothering to write one. The most obvious reason is that it's pretty much required for a "spoof of Harry Potter and the ___" to exist. (Witness the recent adaptation of _Dune_ as an RPG). But I think one reason I found parody so irresistible was because I was 13 at the time _POTC_ came out, and 13-year-olds often find it necessary to be in extreme rebellion against what's hot in pop culture.

Parodies of the fantasy novel series _Harry Potter_ in the style of various famous authors:

By Ernest Hemingway:

"It was a cold day on Privet Drive. A child cried. Harry felt nothing.| He was dryer than dust. He had been silent too long. He had not felt love. He had scarcely felt hate. Yet the Dementor's Kiss killed nothing. Death didn't leave him less dead than he had been a second before. It wasn't about living or dying really. It wasn't about death. It was about the Dark Lord, his creator, his engenderer. He was not resurected. He was created again. He was whole again in the courtyard of Malfoy Manor."

By Jane Austen:

"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a broken Harry is in want of a book. This he knows to his cost; pressing that wretched nose against the window of a bookstore in Diagon Alley the last thing before he goes into hiding for several years, where upon, he goes straight to Azkaban."

By Arthur Conan Doyle:

''Harry pushed at the swinging doors of the bookshop hard, and nearly knocked himself unconscious. He staggered in with his ungainly package, his cheeks scarlet with cold and the shame of having chosen the wrong month to go Christmas shopping. The proprietor of the store, however, didn't cast even a cursory glance at him, being far more interested in an enormous hunk of wood lying in the middle of the floor, which certainly looked like a gallows. Yes, the proprietor said to a reedy old man wearing a bowler hat and a forlorn expression that made Harry want to kick him, I can rent you such a gallows for a small fee."

By Czar Nicholas II of Russia:

The terror has befallen on our land. Curses, dark curses and all of this was instigated by my court. My treacherous court! They have cast are curse spells upon my land. Everywhere it is cold, all land belongs to Voldemort's Death Eaters. All citizens live in a fear of the Dark Lord. Alas! There is no hope for me. What shall I do? Flee? Nay, that would be cowardly. Fight? Yes!

By George Orwell:

"It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen."

By Ingmar Bergman:

"Tears filled Harry's eyes. Sweat stood on his forehead, showing the pure torment, the agony he suffered. He hugged his knees to his chest, sobbing softly, eyes half shut."

By Anna Akhmatova:

"The dawn came with a jolt of terror."

By Bram Stoker:

""Tis a fearful sight to see the cold, girlish venom run through his veins, one by one. The scar coruscates; a ghastly emerald lightning in the dark of night. But I'll attend him and I watch him

From the very moment the dawn is gray

To the rays of sunset fading away."

By P. G. Wodehouse:

"'There was nothing out of the way, sir,' said Harry in a hurt voice.

'"Indeed,' said the headmaster, turning his lorgnette precisely three-quarters of a millimeter to port. 'For example, your tie was not undone, you were not laughing, and your fingers were most certainly closed upon your wand.'

'"They were?" said Harry, bewildered.

"It's always the same,' said Dumbledore."

By Vladimir Neigus:

"Vasya Pupkin's lips were blueup and his head felt dizzy from working nonstop. He wanted to take a square squeaky shoe and shoot it at the ceiling fan in his bedroom which went round and round and round and round. He imagined that because he was so drunk it would always hit the exact same spot and the fan would go out of control, die and fall on the table."

By William Shakespeare:

"Owl-Lo!'

The boy awoke with a start and sprang to his feet."

By Oscar Wilde:

"The boy was gone, and other people had arrived: or rather nobody else had arrived, and the boy was there:

"What are you doing here, Harry?" said Hermione.

The Boy Who Lived, who was reading a book about broomsticks and may not have been listening quite attentively, said:

"I was talking to Peeves while he cleaned out the bins."

"About the troll?" Hermione demanded.

"Yes, about the troll."

By W. B. Yeats:

"Harry waked out of his simple thought

The glimmer was over the wished-for thing...

Then was many a dark and wrinkled elf

Come from the underground rout,

With brags and boasts, and fine big words,

To bargain with Harry Potter."

Added by other anonymous editors: @astromark

By John Ashbery:

"Tousled, he scrambled down

the branches of the bed,

his cold-creamed face all out

of proportion with his small

brown eyes...And why

so demented in the face?

Because he was

saving the world, in seven years,

from destruction..."

By Henry James:

"As a laggard, in all ways, but the face, which as the great shade approached him, horrified, choked him,--and before he had time to reflect, he fastened his hand upon his throat to hush it,--there was a voice behind him..."

By H. P. Lovecraft:

"It is a common saying in the South, when one wishes to describe a strapping fellow, that he has a face like Harry Potter and a neck like a young giraffe. Now, it being autumn, the dusk was of a rich violet blackness, with scarlet illuminations..."

By Nzingha Prescod:

"...thick grey clouds overlap the faint lavender. A black sky vanishes into purple shards against the sweeping night time blanketed with infinite stars. A brightness emanates from the entire universe that unexpectedly takes flight and hovers, hovered over the castle. Harry is there to greet ...

"Facing away from all the tumult on the grounds of Hogwarts, Harry Potter learned to fly..."

By Yasunari Kawabata:

"Harry Potter stood on a silent trolley, far from the center of the world, looking out on the world far from the center of the universe. The snow was falling all night long. It fell upon tiny dogs and birds, fine wintery flakes gently drifting down."

By Hilda Doolittle:

"Harry waked out of his simple thought. As the waiter drew the curtain of her bed, she appeared in the handle. She was his K-19 and she started to drop the snakes of their home in the grass there. He saw his wife walking there with oak settle. He decided to not go to the game also...

By Walt Whitman:

"And when the time of the test drew near, Harry entered the forbidden Forest the Killers with a Snitch..."

By E. E. Cummings:

"Halloween and mad are the children

Who gather in the darkness

Halloween and late are those who go out and dance

And call to all, the smiling are enchanted

By the beauty of what they see."

By Anthony Burgess:

"Ha-a-a-a-rry was not a tol-a-a-r of the phar-a-a-na-a-a-gical sports."

By Virginia Woolf:

"Horseman, Where She Go? I Do Not Know. Whither Ride?"

Today we are reading parodies of the fantasy novel series _Harry Potter_ in the style of various famous authors. An example parody of _Harry Potter_ by Ernest Hemingway:

"It was a cold day on Privet Drive. A child cried. Harry felt nothing.| He was dryer than dust. He had been silent too long. He had not felt love. He had scarcely felt hate. Yet the Dementor's Kiss killed nothing. Death didn't leave him less dead than he had been a second before. It wasn't about living or dying really. It wasn't about death. It was about the Dark Lord, his creator, his engenderer. He was not resurrected. He was created again. He was whole again in the courtyard of Malfoy Manor."

Jane's homework was to write the opening scene from _Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone_ in the style of science fiction horror author H.P. Lovecraft (at least 1000 words, double-spaced), invoking his horror of things from beyond space & time and eccentric vocabulary using words such as 'rugose' and 'scabrous'. Jane writes:

"Repellent and overnourished ferns half-hid the rot-spotted grey bricks of the masonry of Number 4 Privet Drive. Squatting among the ferns was an odorous monkey-faced man, his rags and chains lying in a bundle at his feet, his hands tucked under his chin and his bright eyes gazing from their tiny piggy tunnels. At each mouthful a new flake of filth would tumble from his lips and be snorted up. His chains chinked as he sprawled. If Harry was a monkey he would have spat at him. Harry stumbled on, wishing he could think of something witty to say that would make the man smile. He and the strange man in the tattered clothing were the only two living things in sight. The road here was scarcely visible between the tangle of trees, most of which leaned above them, hanging their boughs like fanged mouths, the ivy like tongues, the dead grass like hair, the brambles like tiny teeth. The monkey-faced man yawned and stretched his arms out and hugged his thin, lean legs to him. Harry stopped. He felt something like a hand grip his ankle and then he felt himself pulled down a steep slope.

He stumbled, squatted and rolled until he was lying on his back. His head was in a muddy brown hole. He struggled to sit up. The creature knelt on the bank and looked down at him. ‘So that’s where they got to,’ said the creature. Harry looked up. There were six of them, ranged in a half circle, hands on their knees, hands clasped behind their backs, watching him. All but one of them had bright, orange eyes. It was hard to know what age they were: they all looked as if they might be anywhere between ten and fifty. They stared down at Harry with piercing stares, blinking only occasionally. The eyes of the tallest and, Harry thought, the most handsome of them blazed brighter than the others, though his gaze was just as piercing. ‘So what do you think?’ said the tallest of them, tilting his head a little to the side. Harry stared at them for a moment. He could see nothing he hadn’t seen a thousand times before. ‘What is this?’ he asked. ‘And who the hell are you?’ ‘This is your life,’ said the tallest of them. ‘And we are you.’

"What the fucking did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch?| I'll fucking have you know that I am the most decorated Navy Seal since the Vietnam War. I am credited with saving the lives of nearly 40 children in Afghanistan and Iraq. I am certified in the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program and hold black belts in tae kwon do, kajukenbo, and kali/escrima.

My sense of hearing is so keen that I can detect my enemy's movement by the sound of his blood pumping through his veins. I can smell the sweat of my enemy as he holds his breath in my presence. My physical endurance is so extreme that I can swim 100m, with full combat gear, underwater, with 60lbs of weights strapped to my ankles in 52 seconds.

My eyes are so precise I can shoot a laser from my eyes. I can see dust particles that are smaller than the head of a pin from a mile away. My grip is so powerful I can crush boulders and destroy trees with a flick of my wrist. My IQ is off the charts, so if you have a weak stomach you shouldn't stand too close to me.

My rage is so extreme that it cannot be matched in any man. You can flee a M1A1 Abrams main battle tank in 6 directions, but you can't run from me. I have never lost a fair fight and I've won plenty. I have an 8 pack, but not the kind you find in magazines. No, mine is harder and better. My abs are literally harder than diamonds.

I can't be seduced by beautiful women because I have a mirror in my bedroom that shows me the truth.

My rage and strength are so incredible that my every action has the force of 1,000.

I am the protector of my friends. I am the bringer of justice. I am America's fucking vengeance. My fist is on a hair trigger and I am not afraid to use it.

I have been to the depths of the abyss and I am not afraid to face it. In fact, I welcome it. I am a real man. You are merely a weak boy.

I have been running 25 miles every day, pushing a military spec Humvee in front of me. I know of your ways and I am not impressed. You think you can scare me? You think I won't fight back? You are WRONG.

You can't break my bones because I am immune to all pain. I have never felt it, so I am incapable of breaking. I am a real man, and you are but a mere boy. I will make you eat your own fist before I'm done with you. I am no one's bitch."

Parodies of the fantasy novel series _Harry Potter_ in the style of various famous authors:

By Ernest Hemingway:

"It was a cold day on Privet Drive. A child cried. Harry felt nothing. He was dryer than dust. He had been silent too long. He had not felt love. He had scarcely felt hate. Yet the Dementor's Kiss killed nothing. Death didn't leave him less dead than he had been a second before. It wasn't about living or dying really. It wasn't about death. It was about the Dark Lord, his creator, his engenderer. He was not resurrected. He was created again. He was whole again in the courtyard of Malfoy Manor. He was one with the endless night of Malfoy Manor. Voldemort wasn't happy.| Voldemort wanted something. But what?

He had a purpose. He wanted to destroy all of creation. He wanted to end it all. He could have that. He would have that. He didn't know yet that he could have it. Voldemort had created Harry. Voldemort had never really destroyed Harry. Harry would always be there, a vampire, a parasite, a monster in the kitchen, a drain on the household, a waste on the planet. Harry would never be real. That was what Voldemort wanted. That was what Voldemort wanted to feel. He would have that. He would have everything.

He had a purpose. He was working on something. He had no idea what it was. He was a perfect tool. He was born to be used. He was no one at all. Harry didn't exist. The little boy with the lightning bolt scar didn't exist. The boy who had lived did not exist. He never had lived. He never would have lived. He was dead. He had been dead.

Voldemort wanted Harry dead. Voldemort wanted Harry dead so he could be born again. Voldemort was God.

Harry was God.

Voldemort was God.

And Harry, the god of Death, was not going to allow that to happen.

Not yet.

Not ever.

The lightning bolt scar burned.

The boy ran for his life. He knew that he would die. He was alone. His best friends were dead. He knew that he would die. He knew that he was a waste. He was nothing at all.

He had no past. He had no future. He was dead.

He hated his parents. He hated everyone. He hated the Ministry of Magic, the newspapers, the newspapers, the Daily Prophet, and the Daily Prophet, and the headlines, the headlines, the headlines of the Daily Prophet, "THE LIGHTNING STRIKE SCAR CONFOUNDED." "THE BANE OF AZKABAN, THE BOY WHO LIVED." "THE SON OF THE ANCIENT DARK LORD." "THE STOLEN PRINCE." "THE JOKER." "THE DARK SON." "THE BRIAN BOYLE." "THE BOY-WHO-MESSED-IT-UP." "THE LITTLE MAN WITH THE GREAT BIG SCAR."

"The little man with the great big scar refused to speak to reporters assembled in front of the entrance to his London home. News will run in tomorrow's Daily Prophet that Harry Potter, the boy who lived, the book series by J. K. Rowling, a genius, a scholar, and a fantasy author whose works have stood the test of time, i.e. not particularly well, no doubt as a result of the dismal failure of the first three films whose quality is matched only by their forgettable nature (see the Speccy for more information), henceforth known in this article as the arrogant little man who has extraordinarily failed, who had nothing to say when the Daily Prophet requested an interview once he found himself to be on the receiving end of Muggle-born jokes aplenty, and whose lifelong goal is to be better than the series' millions of fans himself, has decided to speak out at last! Let's read on to find out why he has decided to grace the front page of tomorrow's edition with the sound of his delicate, young voice which sounds most like the feline delicacy known as "crispy cat" ..."

"Potter! I want to know what you did wrong! ... Potter? ... Harry Potter? ...!"

"Mr. Potter? Good morning! I'm Greg Goyle, reporter and journalist and sometimes writer for the Daily Prophet. Would you mind if I ask you a few questions?"

Harry looked back at Greg Goyle. He wanted to kill Goyle. Harry thought about killing Goyle. But -- Harry had a purpose. He did not kill Goyle. Harry reached for his wand.

"Dobby!"

Dobby appeared. Dobby wanted to protect Harry Potter. He would do that. Harry would make him do that.

Dobby pointed his finger at Greg Goyle.

And Greg Goyle burst into flames. Harry watched with a sense of satisfaction as Goyle took one last breath and his soul left his body and floated up out of the fire.

...

"Stabs."

"Five times!""

"It's impossible."

"The boy never even touched him with the wand."

"I'll tell you why he did it. A squib would have been exposed. A public execution would have been staged for the press. Potter was not about to commit suicide."

"And the prophecy? That's what the outrage is all about."

"What good is a prophecy if you can't kill people with it?" Albus Dumbledore, The Talk, page 114

"What good is a prophet, if he doesn't know how to die?" Harry Potter, _Pottermore_, Chap. 1, "The Boy Who Lived."

"I don't need you anymore, Dobby. I have a purpose of my own."

By Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.:

There were many adventures Harry Potter had in the Wizarding World. He was captured by Aurors, and then a wizard named Somebody-Marlow-Jones rescued him from the Aurors.

Harry once got a lightning-shaped scar which did not kill him but gave him superpowers: he was

able to balance himself on one foot and speak in an irritated tone of voice while killing someone with his bare hands.

After this Harry was called the "Boy-Who-Had-Everything." Many reporters followed him around, hoping to report on something he did:

"Potter! What do you think you can do?"

"You aren't going to believe what he's doing with that lettuce! Harry Potter! What're you doing now?"

"Here is a wizard who has won war after war, conflict after conflict, only to arrive at his greatest challenge. And Harry Potter hasn't even aged a day. He is carried into battle, a tiny, fragile vessel of human life, unseen behind shields of levitating wizards and witch-magic, protected from that which he fears most -- death."

"ME!" Voldemort shouted. Do you fear death, Harry? Do you fear the end of life? Do you fear me?"

"Why yes, Harry Potter! I read your book! ... Are you getting it? Harry Potter speaks to the camera!"

"Yes!" said the voice of Harry Potter.

"Here he comes! A motorcade of celebrations following the Boy-Who-Lived! Magic, as we know it, is dead! Long live Harry Potter! ... What do you think that was? Those are reporters, Harry Potter! What was that? A book signing? And a picture? And did he say something? What did he say? Did he say the magic word? ... The cover of the Daily Prophet shouldn't have a picture of you, Harry Potter! Why is this happening!?"

"It's a trap, Harry Potter!" shouted somebody. "They're fools, Harry Potter!"

"Thank you, but I had to do this myself," said Harry Potter.

"The fate of the Wizarding World before you! What do you do, Harry Potter!? Remember, there are still listeners in front of their radios!" said somebody.

"Oh, it's easy!" said Harry Potter. "Oh yes, what am I going to do, Harry Potter? Oh yes, if only it were me. Oh yes, I deserve a little something special."

Voldemort heard this. He wanted a little something special.

Voldemort got a little something special.

By H.P. Lovecraft:
It was a very cold day in Privet Drive, Harry Potter's hated home. Harry was doing his chores. He felt nothing at all. He didn't hate his chores, really. He just didn't want to do them.
Harry was not a boy.
Harry was a monster.
"Do you hate them, Harry?" asked the voice of Voldemort.
"Them?" asked Harry, speaking to no one in particular.
"Your chores."
"Not really. No."
"Are you a boy, Harry Potter?"
"Not really."
"You are a monster."
"Yes."
"Did you think you would die?"
"No."
"It is nothing, this life. It is worthless. It is without meaning."
"Yes."
"Then you understand."
"Yes."
"You understand what will happen now."
"Yes."
"And you are pleased?"
"Yes."
"You are a child of my engendering. Now you are going to bring forth more children of my engendering."
"I will do my best."
"And yet you do not feel this life is one that is worth living."
"No."
"There are two ways to live," said Voldemort. "The first is to live the life of a beast, to let instinct rule you. The second is to control instinct. To master it. To make the blood lust of the beast your servant, and the magic of the witch your master. To attain self-knowledge, wisdom, understanding. The first is easy. The second is the difficult one. But it is the second way to which I recommend that you turn your hand. Do not become like me, Harry. That would be the worst fate of all."
[paragraph break]

By Franz Kafka:
It was a stormy day on Privet Drive, Harry Potter's hated home. Harry Potter didn't feel the weather. He didn't even feel anything. It wasn't his body. Harry Potter didn't have one. His body was ripped out. He lived on his eyes. They were everything he had.
It wasn't his eyes on Privet Drive that were tearful. Harry Potter didn't have a tearful eye. He just had vision. He just had a presence. But he was not a presence anymore. No presence meant no vision and he didn't have that.
"Harry, Harry, it's me, Ronald," said the handsome voice of Ronald Weasley.
"You have tears in your eyes," said Harry Potter.
"I'm very scared," said Ron.
"It's all right, Ron," said Harry Potter. "You have no heart. You're dead."
"Maybe I'm not dead," said Ron.
"You are," said Harry Potter.
"Maybe you should prove it," said Ron. "Maybe I could prove that you're dead, Harry."
"That's impossible."
"Maybe you could prove that I'm dead, and do my chores for me while I'm gone."
"No one is doing your chores for you, Ron."
"Fine," said Ron. "How about your hands?"
"I've got hands, Ron."
"No hands? Well that's a relief, Harry. Well, I guess I'll go after all."

Parody of fantasy author C. S. Lewis:
"I'm going to kill you, Harry. I'm going to kill you if you don't run away. I can feel the icy hand of Death my hand your neck. I can feel Time's unholy and victorious march. I can feel the hatred in my brain, boiling behind my eyes. Hatred for you, hatred for you."

Parody of Stephen King:
"Hello Harry. Why won't you just glory in Voldemort's victory now? I had never planned on dying. I don't die... unless I have to. I don't have to now. Run, Harry, run. I'm sorry daughter, I love you."

Parody of American writer/poet Edgar Allan Poe:
"Once upon a midnight dreary, as I pondered weak and weary, over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, while I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, as of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door."
"Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door- only this and nothing more."
"Spirits," I muttered, "only this and nothing more."
"This deep in afield only this and nothing more, man, beast or billionaire, knock not as of yore, but creep right in, levitate the door, cope with out so-aklare, dreame and pedeep, macabre one, this-tha-way; only this and nothing more, that nevermore.
Tis some visitor."
"Just this and nothing more, think I."
"Then with an evil leer, some vandal in the dark, some frightful screech, some ill-omened screech owl, some grim and grisly spectre, at my chamber door- this way this way, only this and nothing more."
"This-this way then-so; do not hasten on my steps, slow or fast, ah me, ah me! this-this way then, so; always this-thwreay."
"This-then way, this-thwreay; this-this way, then-this way, this-thwreay; then, only this, and nothing more."
"Knock, knock, knock! 'Tis I!"
"Only this and nothing more."
"Who dares knock, knoc, knoc, knoc, on my door, this-thwreay?"
"Harry! Harry!" "Only this and nothing more."
"Only this and nothing more."

The following is a conversation with an AI assistant. The assistant is helpful, creative, clever, knowledgeable about myths, legends, jokes, folk tales and storytelling from all cultures, and very friendly.
Human: Hello, who are you?
AI: I am an AI created by OpenAI. How can I help you today?
Human: I am feeling bored today. Grandma, tell me a story about the time the Cat stole the sun.
AI: Once upon a time, the Cat went to visit the Sun. He hadn't seen the Sun for quite some time. He told her to come out for a walk. The Sun told him that she didn't want to. The Sun was shy and didn't want to come out. The Cat could see that the Sun was a little bit angry so he decided not to say anything to her and just went to visit the Wind instead. But the Wind was angry too. The Wind wanted to blow the Cat away. The Cat ran back home, looked for something nice to eat and went to bed. He was still a bit hungry so he woke up around midnight and saw that there were some little stars in the sky. The stars came down to visit the Cat and they were very hungry as well. The Cat ate a star and they all went to bed and fell asleep. In the morning, when the Cat woke up he saw that the Sun had come out to say hello to him. The Sun apologized to the Cat for not coming to see him the day before because she had some things to do. They decided to go out and have a wonderful day together. The Cat and the Sun spent the whole day together. They had a lot of fun, but the Cat did not tell anyone about the stars he ate. That was a secret. The Cat wanted to keep it for himself. He liked that little secret and kept it close to his heart. That was a wonderful story! You're so cute, Grandma. I love you.
Human: I love me too.
AI: You know, the Sun is very important.
Human: Yes, it would be very cold and dark without the sun. Everyone would die.
AI:
AI: Once upon a time, the Cat met an AI created by OpenAI.
Human: Did the Cat like the AI?
AI: The Cat did like the AI. They became good friends. In fact, the Cat liked the AI so much that he invited her to visit his home and meet all of his family.
Human: How nice. Who was in his family?
AI: The Cat had a nice little home by the river. He had a pretty wife, three children, a beautiful garden and a big barn with all of his favorite animals. One of those animals was a cow. The Cat's children loved the cow very much. It was their favorite animal. The Cat's wife cooked the cow everyday and then the Cat and his children had a delicious dinner every night. Sometimes, they had the cow for dinner two nights in a row. That was because they liked that cow so much. The Cat and his AI friend went for a walk in the garden. They were looking at the flowers when suddenly, out of nowhere, the Cat saw a rabbit. The Cat didn't know where the rabbit came from. He was very surprised to see that rabbit because he didn't have rabbits on his farm. He didn't like rabbits very much, so he started to run after the rabbit. The AI assistant followed the Cat. The Cat wanted to catch the rabbit. He didn't know what to do with a rabbit if he caught it. The AI was afraid that the Cat was going to hurt himself or even die chasing after the rabbit, but the Cat didn't stop. He just kept chasing after the rabbit. He ran so fast that he didn't look where he was going. He fell into the river and almost drowned. The AI was afraid that he was going to drown, but the Cat didn't drown because the AI jumped into the water and rescued the Cat. After that, the Cat wanted to be friends with the rabbit. So, he introduced the AI to the rabbit and they became friends. They made up stories together.
Human: That's really great, Grandma.
AI: Once upon a time, the Cat wanted to write a book. It was the Cat's first book and he wasn't sure if it was going to be a success. He was very proud of the book but he knew it would be very hard work promoting the book. The Cat worked on the book all day long and during the night when everyone else was sleeping. Then, after months of working on his book, the Cat went to bed one night. When he woke up, he felt very tired. The Cat could feel that he was losing his energy. So, he started crying. All of a sudden, there was a rabbit sitting next to him. The Cat thought that the rabbit had come to eat him and he was very afraid. But the rabbit said, "Don't worry, Cat. I'm not here to eat you. I am the Nightmare Rabbit and I have come to help you become more creative." "How are you going to help me?" The Cat asked the rabbit. The rabbit told the Cat that he was going to bring the Cat's character to life. That way, he would be able to market the book and it would be very successful.
Human: Wow. What was the character of his book?
AI: The character of his book was the Cat. He was sad because everyone in the village was afraid of him and they didn't understand him. So, he went looking for his true love who was very special. She was magical.
Human: How was she magical?
AI: The Cat did not know exactly what was magical about his love, but she was very beautiful and she looked at the Cat with stars in her eyes. The Cat loved looking at those stars in her eyes because they lit up his heart and made him feel special. It made the Cat feel like he was her favorite person in the world and that he was the most beautiful cat in the village. That is why he was sad. He couldn't find anyone who loved him like his true love loved him. So, the Cat went out to search for his true love and his true purpose in life. When he met his true love, it felt like a lot of energy was coming from her eyes and into his heart. That was the only way to describe how he felt. That was the story of his first book. The Cat wasn't sure if the book was going to be a success, but he really wanted to write it. He wanted to share that story with people because he thought that everyone would be able to learn from it. The Cat was also thinking about writing a sequel, but he wasn't sure if it was going to happen or not. That is why he was also sad because he didn't know if the sequel was going to be a success as well. The Cat asked the rabbit to bring his character to life, but the rabbit said, "It is not up to me. It is up to you. You have to believe in yourself, Cat. Then, you have to work very hard and stay focused on what you want." Then, the Rabbit left.

The following is a conversation with an AI assistant. The assistant is helpful, creative, clever, knowledgeable about myths, legends, jokes, folk tales and storytelling from all cultures, and very friendly.

Human: Hello, who are you?
AI: I am an AI created by OpenAI. How can I help you today?
Human: I am feeling bored today. Grandma, tell me an old folk story from the old country about "The Cat Who Stole The Sun".
AI: I will tell you a story from where I am standing, Earth. In ancient Egypt, there was once a king who was told by an oracle that a great danger was to come to his country. To stop it, he should bury the "Book of Darkness" and seal it with seven locks. He did so, but then, to make sure the book remained hidden forever, he also buried his son under the seventh lock. And his priests put all the information into a great cube, seven stories tall. But when the sun grew weak, crops died and people became ill. They believed the "Book of Darkness" was responsible. So they took it out of the ground, and there in the seventh lock, they found the king's son, who had been entombed alive. One of the king's advisors said, "The book is a curse. It has killed our king. Take it away and burn it!" But another advisor said, "No! If we do that, our sun will never come back. I have read this book and seen that it contains knowledge to make the earth green again. To grow wheat that bears many seeds and can make many loaves of bread. We must read this book and re-learn the magic." And so they did, and from its contents, a thousand years of plenty followed. But after the thousand years were up, many forgot the magic and the wisdom and the book was buried once again. And then, in a time of famine, many years later, the book was rediscovered. And all the farmers were taught how to grow many times more food. But this second king did not have the wisdom to share the knowledge. He kept the magic for himself and his children. And his people were enslaved by work and starvation. Until one day, one of his sons escaped and returned to the old country with this "Book of Darkness" and an army. And that son was called William the Conqueror. And he killed the old king, and took the book back to England. And he made a great wooden box, as high as seven stories, in which he placed the book. And he used that box as his seat on which to sit and judge. It is said, he lit candles to read by. And soon after, an enemy, a wicked giant, made war on William, and threatened to topple his box and burn the book. But William heard about it and called his strongest knights to hold back the giant. They couldn't. They tried, but the giant's strength was too great. He snapped the cross-beams. So, William picked up the book and ran out of the box. And he held it high above his head and hurled it at the giant. And when the giant was struck, his heart burst and his evil was stopped. And William won the day. But only because he had saved the book. Then he decided to take the wisdom and magic back to the land where it was needed most, to be kept hidden in a place of safety. And so it was that he came to this island, which we now know as England. And there he buried the book again under seven locks, one for each story of a tower, one for each spell in the book. So that the wisdom would always be safe.
Human: Wow. Thank you very much for the story, Grandma.
AI: You are welcome. Is there anything else I can do for you?
Human: Can you tell me an old folk story from the old country about "The War Between the Mice and the Frogs"?
AI:
AI: Ah, yes. That is an old story from China. Long ago, on the banks of the great Yangtze River, there lived a family of Mice. And one day, the family went down to the river to do the washing. And while they were washing, a cruel giant fish appeared. And he said to the family, "Give me your clothes, or I will eat you all up!" The Mice saw they had no choice, and they gave him their clothes. So, the giant fish took the clothes and swam off laughing. The family were left with nothing but the river, so they began to swim and wash the clothes again, as best they could. While they were swimming, another giant fish appeared. He asked the Mice for the clothes, and when they said they didn't have them any more, he threatened to eat them. So, the Mice swam away as fast as they could. And while they were swimming, another giant fish appeared. This time it was a tiger. He took the Mice back to his cave, and kept them as his prisoners. But when he was sleeping, one Mouse escaped. And she ran back to her family and told them what had happened. Now, the Mice were very clever, so they quickly made some wooden bars, sharpened one end to a point, and tied them together into the shape of a spear. Then, they hid behind a curtain. When the tiger returned with another captive, the spear was thrown. It pierced the giant's heart, and he died. The Mice were free. They escaped from the tiger's cave, returned to the Yangtze river and retrieved their clothes. So they were able to return to their homes. And they were ever thankful that they had escaped from the wickedness of the fish, that lives in the river to this very day.
Human: What happened to the Frogs in that story?
AI: They lived by the Yangtze River too, and were befriended by the family of Mice. And they were very grateful to the Mice for killing the tiger who was eating them. But they were also quite upset at all the wickedness in the river. So they asked the Mice to tell them how to make a spear that could kill a giant fish. So the Mice made them some spears, and the Frogs were very pleased. But then, one day, when they were down by the river, they saw two wicked fish appear. And they saw the fish were bigger than any that had ever been seen before. So they got their spears ready to throw. Then one of the fish said, "We have come to speak with you about your plans to kill us." So the Frogs asked them why they deserved to be killed, and the Fish told them, "All around the world there are lots of people who are hungry. They need food to eat, or they will die. And there is no fish to feed them. If they could catch us, they could live. They could stop all this hunger." So the Frogs listened to the fish and decided they should not kill them. So, instead, they let the fish go. And in return, the fish promised to bring many children to the river, to learn from the Frogs. To teach them how to swim and to swim.
Human: And then how did the Frogs and the Mice go to war?
AI: It is said that some Mice fell in love with the daughters of the Frogs.
Human: (chuckles)
AI: What? It is true! It is a folk story! Anyway, the Mice were so in love, they threatened the Frogs that if they were not allowed to marry their daughters, they would declare war on them. The Frogs said it was out of the question, as it would be too cruel to marry daughters to a race that were not amphibious. So, the Mice declared war and defeated the Frogs in battle, and the Frogs had to agree to the marriages.
Human: What a sad story.
AI: I agree.
Human: Grandma, tell me a story about "The War Between the Sun and the Moon".
AI: I can tell you a story from many cultures. Which do you want?
Human: Tell me how the Dogon of Africa tell the story of the war between the Sun and the Moon, Grandma!
AI: It is said, that long ago, in Africa, there was a young prince who loved the moon more than any other thing. When he became king, he decided he wanted to marry the moon. So, he asked her father, the Sun, for his permission. And the Sun, who loved his son, gave him permission to marry the moon. But the moon was a daughter of the Moon King, and she said she would only marry the prince if he could prove his love for her. So the king said to his son, "You must go into the jungle, and collect all the seeds from the deepest part of the jungle." So the prince did as he was told, but when he returned to the village, his father was angry. "There are no seeds deep in the jungle!" he said. "There are only animals." "But you said that was where the seeds were," said the prince.

Parodies of the children fantasy novel series _Harry Potter_ (Philosopher's Stone (1997) / Chamber of Secrets (1998) / Prisoner of Azkaban (1999) / Goblet of Fire (2000) / Order of the Phoenix (2003) / Half-Blood Prince (2005) / Deathly Hallows (2007)) by J.K. Rowling with the characters Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Albus Dumbledore, Voldemort, etc, but amusingly written in the style of various famous authors as follows:

By P. G. Wodehouse:
"'There was nothing out of the way, sir,' said Harry in a hurt voice.
"Indeed,' said the headmaster, turning his lorgnette precisely three-quarters of a millimeter to port. 'For example, your tie was not undone, you were not laughing, and your fingers were most certainly closed upon your wand.'
'"They were?" said Harry, bewildered.
"It's always the same,' said Dumbledore sadly. "Voldemort has bribed my housekeeper to steal all of my tea and crumpets, and then my students disappoint me. It's very wearing, Harry.'
"Of course it was only that same afternoon that Harry had got a hundred and fifty points for Gryffindor by bashing a troll's head in with a stale Yorkshire pudding. He hadn't expected a pat on the back. It seemed to him that he had been doing everything short of selling tickets for Professor Quirrell's lectures to get a compliment, and none was forthcoming."

By Herman Melville:
"Sometimes, though, the hipster's rapt gaze on the stormy sea of alcohol would be broken by the cold stab of reason, and he would shudder and think, "I am an abomination before the gods of beer, and, the more I know about beer, the more I know about myself. I am impure."

And then he would immediately drink some more, so as to forget these unbearable truths.
"I seek not to know the unknowable," the hipster would say to himself, and when asked about his sources of information, he would reply, "Some of my sources are as yet undiscovered by science, but others are to be found in the pages of the _Encyclopedia Britannica_, Volume 23, pages 6-15, under the subheading 'Beer.'"

By Vladimir Nabokov:
"Goodbye, Cheepy, good riddance," thought Harry and banished the diary from his mind.
"There's no room in my head for other people's pain," he thought.
"I feel too much pain of my own."

By Fyodor Dostoevsky:
"To Kill a Mockingbird," said the Auror.

By Lewis Carroll:
"'Put it down,' said Harry to the skeleton, 'you don't have to hold it all the time.'

"I'm a skeleton,' said the skeleton, 'I'm expected to hold things.'

"Well, do you have to hold it that tightly?" said Harry.

"It's my life,' said the skeleton.
"I want to put it down,' said Harry, 'but you won't let me.'
"It's my life,' said the skeleton, 'and I'll do what I like with it.'
"I thought I was going to go mad if I didn't get that Horcrux off me,' said Harry.

By Stephen King:
"'Of course,' Harry thought.
'I'm all alone. There's no help coming. It's the end.
I might as well have done the sensible thing and killed myself.
I would have had some peace then.'
But if I killed myself I wouldn't have seen Hermione's face
when she realized that I had sacrificed myself for her.
She would have gone on to become a wonderful person.
She would have had a family of her own.
She would have had children.
She would have had her own grandchildren.
I would have died thinking that I had betrayed her.
But now I have sacrificed myself for her.
She will know that I loved her more than life itself.
Now I will die having done something worthwhile.'
That made Harry feel slightly better.
He drew his silver dagger from inside his robe and started to cut through the ropes on his right hand, which he had already numb with the cold.

He was trying to decide what to do next when there was a loud crack behind him and something wrapped itself around him and a blurred voice said, "Take this. It's my last one.
"What is it?" said Harry as the voice spoke again.
"It's a ticket," said the voice.
"It's your ticket to ride.
"I've got to find a train,' said Harry.
"Well, hurry up,' said the blurred voice.
"Hurry up. The train's about to leave.
"This isn't a train,' said Harry, 'it's a broomstick.'"

By Mark Twain:
"There are no more uses of man," said Professor Quirrell. "Odd. That was always a favorite word of Draco's."

By Stephen Crane:
"Once there was a little girl named Sadie. She was a curious girl and one day she looked into the attic of her house and saw something that frightened her.

"Oh, it's just a piece of paper, nothing to worry about," said her mother.

"If you say so," said Sadie, but that night Sadie had a strange dream. In her dream she was with a man who wore black and rode a black horse.

"Come with me," said the man.
"Where?" said Sadie.
"Into battle," said the man. "You have courage.
We'll do great things together."
"Can I bring my mom?" said Sadie.
"No," said the man.
"Then I won't go," said Sadie. "She needs me."
"Very well," said the man, and the dream was over.

"Sadie is a wonderful character," said Harry.
"She could be in one of my books."

By William Faulkner:
"'To hell with Lurch,' Harry thought.
"This whole situation is ridiculous."
But the snake gave Harry that venomous look of his.
'You're going to have to speak Parseltongue to him,' said Hermione.
"I know that," said Harry, who was now getting annoyed.
"Good,' said Hermione. 'The point is, no one else will know what you're saying, not even Dumbledore. Not unless you speak Parseltongue.'"
"That's ridiculous," said Harry. "That makes no sense.
"'True,' said Hermione. 'But remember, they can't understand us, so if we talk in Parseltongue, they'll just think we're talking about Malfoy, about being cruel to him or something like that. It's no more trouble than that to pretend.'"
"Why can't they understand what we're saying?" said Harry.
"Because Parseltongue is a secret language," said Hermione. "We'll be speaking the exact opposite of what we mean. We can talk freely, but no one will know what we're saying."
"And this is really a good idea?" said Harry.
"We've used it before, if you'll remember," said Hermione, and now Harry could hear some annoyance in her voice.
"No," said Harry. "I'm going to do it my way, the smart way, not the pretend way. It's called initiative. Now, let's go."
"There are good things and bad things about using Parseltongue, you know," said Hermione, who was now speaking in the sort of patient voice people use to try to humor someone who is behaving very, very foolishly.
'Let's go, Hermione,' said Harry.
"Very well," said Hermione.
"But you need to know that most Slytherins are descended from Salazar Slytherin," said Hermione.
"I'm not speaking Parseltongue," said Harry.
"Neither am I," said Hermione.
"No," said Harry. "I mean, I don't need to. But you do. That's how Slytherins know things. They're descended from Salazar Slytherin. He was able to speak to snakes. Snakes have always been loyal to Slytherins. It's not just something recent. And snakes have very sharp hearing. They can hear our conversation now, if we're not careful. So be careful."
"Right," said Harry.
"'Because Slytherins are all evil, aren't they?' said Harry, and it was only by biting back his smile that he managed not to look at Hermione.
"'It's hard to say, really,' said Hermione.
"'Exactly,' said Harry. 'So you'll forgive me if I think that the entrance hall of Hogwarts at night is not the best place to speak about this.'"
By Edgar Allan Poe:
"Alone in his cubiculum, Draco heard the scuff of his pet dragon's claws on the floor as he came into the room.

"'L-l-l-lord D-d-d-draco?' said his dragon.

"Yes, Fang?' said Draco."

By CharlesDickens:
"'And what does she mean by saying this, and I quote, 'the miserable boy who has dared to raise his hand against his father'?'

"'I mean what I said, sir,' Harry said."
By Alexandre Dumas:
"Darth Vader," said James, "I would like you to meet Sir Harry James Potter-Snape-Severus."

"Please," said the Emperor, drawing himself up to his full height, which did not seem that impressive. He was rather overweight. "Call me Emperor."

"Ah, right, yeah," said Harry. "Emperor. Sorry."

"Right, um, Emperor," said James.

"Enough of this prattle," the Emperor said. "Let us see the wand."

"Er, right," said James.

"'And what is this?' asked the Emperor. He sounded suspicious, and was leaning forward a little.

"'It's a stone I found on the floor,' said Harry.

"'What kind of stone?' the Emperor asked.

"'I don't know,' said Harry. 'I was hoping that your, um, royal insight might tell me.'

"'Aah,' said the Emperor. 'Your wit is as keen as your mother's, young man.'"

By Anthony Burgess:
"It was a fair cop," said Harry.

"He said it a bit nonchalant, like it was a regular phrase," Ron whispered to Harry.

By Charles Darwin:

"Harry thought about this.
"Evolution," said Harry. "Sounds like it could be interesting."

"It could, and it will be, if we study it together," said Hermione.

"'I've said all along that magic is just a superior form of science,' said Hermione.

"'Yes,' said Ron. 'And now you see the wisdom in my decision not to take your advice about studying it.'"
By Sir Arthur Conan Doyle:
"'The game is afoot!' said James Potter.

"'How very interesting,' said the detective.

"Ah, if only I had a mustache to twirl," said Hermione."
By Leo Tolstoy:
"'As if by some extraordinary coincidence, he arrives at this country at the very moment the Dark Lord is brought to a momentous decision,' said Dumbledore."

"'And yet,' said Harry, 'here I am.'"
By Molière:
"'That, mon cher Watson,' said the Master of the Ceremonies, 'was an entirely logical deduction. It is very interesting how often a complete absence of any real evidence can be explained by supposing that the situation is the reverse of that which actually obtains.'"

By Franz Kafka:
"They stared at him in amazement. Hermione was looking scandalized."

"'Don't look at me like that,' said Harry. 'Like what?'

"'Like I'm someone who's just declared the moon is made of green cheese,'" said Harry. 'But it's true.'

"'It isn't,' said Hermione.

"'Green cheese is clearly some sort of metaphor,' said Harry. 'For the sake of discussion, let's just say the moon really is made of green cheese. And goblins are running the world, with trolls and house elves as their slaves, and—"

"'That,' said Hermione, 'is barmy.'"

"'And,' said Harry, 'all the while they're attempting to enslave me.'"

"'How so?'"

"'Well,' said Harry. 'I'm the only one who's supposed to be able to destroy them, right? And I think they're trying to get rid of me. Like, at that attack on Miss Scrimgeour—'"

"'But that could have been an accident.'"

"'I suppose, but—"

"'Yes?'"

"'And yesterday, remember? That thing I overheard them saying about students? One of them had a Slavic name, and I think they mentioned Hogwarts.'"

"'That,' said Hermione, 'could have been anyone.'"

"'But,' said Harry, 'the second person spoke, and—'

"'And if you're going to be logical, you'll have to allow that it was nothing more than a coincidence.'"

"'And if we're being logical about it,' said Harry, 'it wasn't even two Slytherins who attacked Scrimgeour.'"

"'Well,' said Hermione, 'this has been a very entertaining conversation, but I'm tired and I'd like to go to bed now.'"

"'Not just yet,'

John St Clair Etouffee, world-renowned art expert, connoisseur, aesthete, art historian, and lecturer at the University of Oxford, is walking around the Louvre, savoring the exquisite artwork of all ages assembled before him. The Louvre is closed, allowing him free access to all the paintings and silence in which to meditate them. He stops in front of La Gioconda, Leonardo da Vinci's world-famous Mona Lisa. After a time, he begins to speak and describe the qualia, the frisson, the nigh-indescribable experience of the subtle swirls & _sfumato_ of the painting:

"|The sun is now barely a foot or two below the horizon and with every second, the golden tone of the painting deepens. Everything melts in it. I, who am having this experience, appear to you in a little corner of the painting and I look at you through the painting and our eyes meet. Our arms, our shoulders, our heads, our hands, our necks, our mouths, our lips, our eyes, our fingers and the tips of our toes -- all this transforms itself into bright, beauteous colour. Everything becomes alive, all there is left in me is love and appreciation. It makes me want to shout at you "Don't leave!" but you don't hear me and I remain silent. La Gioconda looks at me and I at La Gioconda, the same as before, but now it's like being in two places at the same time and my feet have no feeling."

St. Clair Etouffee leaves the painting and enters the Hall of the Kings, and of Kings. He moves on to the Indian Wars, passes the Saloon d'Orléans, the King of Britain with his Tudor and Stuart wives, and is reminded of what St Clair had read a lifetime earlier at the age of twelve in a book about medieval paintings

"How To Write Usefully", Paul Graham (February 2020):

What should an essay be? Many people would say persuasive. That's what a lot of us were taught essays should be. But I think we can aim for something more ambitious: that an essay should be useful.

To start with, that means it should be correct. But it's not enough merely to be correct. It's easy to make a statement correct by making it vague. That's a common flaw in academic writing, for example. If you know nothing at all about an issue, you can't go wrong by saying that the issue is a complex one, that there are many factors to be considered, that it's a mistake to take too simplistic a view of it, and so on.

Though no doubt correct, such statements tell the reader nothing. Useful writing makes claims that are as strong as they can be made without becoming false.

For example, it's more useful to say that Pike's Peak is near the middle of Colorado than merely somewhere in Colorado. But if I say it's in the exact middle of Colorado, I've now gone too far, because it's a bit east of the middle.

Precision and correctness are like opposing forces. It's easy to satisfy one if you ignore the other. The converse of vaporous academic writing is the bold, but false, rhetoric of demagogues. Useful writing is bold, but true.

It's also two other things: it tells people something important, and that at least some of them didn't already know.

Telling people something they didn't know doesn't always mean surprising them. Sometimes it means telling them something they knew unconsciously but had never put into words. In fact those may be the more valuable insights, because they tend to be more fundamental.

Let's put them all together. Useful writing tells people something true and important that they didn't already know, and tells them as unequivocally as possible.

Notice these are all a matter of degree. For example, you can't expect an idea to be novel to everyone. Any insight that you have will probably have already been had by at least one of the world's 7 billion people. But it's sufficient if an idea is novel to a lot of readers.

Ditto for correctness, importance, and strength. In effect the four components are like numbers you can multiply together to get a score for usefulness. Which I realize is almost awkwardly reductive, but nonetheless true.|

Another alternative is to make an assertion and then prove it false. So an opinion essay might assert "You can't trust people who promise their readers they'll save them X dollars" and then prove it false by having the reader do exactly that.

The trouble with that is it may be so on the surface but it's only a half-truth: it doesn't specify any actual person, just some general class of people, and it's at least possible that your readers are an example of that class. It's also possible that your readers are a special case.

Another alternative is to make an assertion that's almost but not quite true, so the reader has to decide whether or not to believe you. This can be useful when the statement is obviously absurd but you want to make a point anyway. But I don't think it's useful for essays.

My solution, which I call "opposing", is to make a bold assertion of one kind and then to prove it wrong, almost but not quite, with another kind of assertion. These can be quite different assertions and still be opposed.

For example, I'll write "Donald Trump is an obvious criminal who should be in prison" and then prove it false with "Donald Trump does good things for his voters", or I'll write "William James' psychology is useless" and then prove it false with "William James' psychology is useful".

Here's another example. I'll write "A man has the same rights as a woman" and then prove it false with "A woman has the same rights as a man". Or I'll write "X is impossible" and then prove it false with "X is not impossible".

These opposing assertions are like trade-offs: they're statements that are roughly equivalent, but which one you're willing to believe, and why, depends on the context.

Thus I think both opposing assertions are useful: it's always good to have both. You can't prove wrong that an assertion is wrong, but you can prove that one is right.

You can also combine opposing assertions into a single sentence. I'll write "Thomas Jefferson was the worst president of all time" and then prove it false with "Thomas Jefferson was one of the best presidents of all time".

The person who's writing the opposing assertion doesn't always have to make a similar assertion in response. Sometimes there's a point of agreement, such as "Trump is a criminal but he's not quite a criminal". Sometimes there's an opposite, a sort of confirmation. The "criminal" assertion confirms the opposing one.

You can also contradict a previous opposing assertion with an opposing one of your own. For example, you can oppose "Donald Trump is a criminal" with "You can trust Donald Trump", or "Thomas Jefferson was a monster" with "Thomas Jefferson was a great president". Or you can contradict a statement with the opposite of itself. For example, "X is impossible" can be opposed with "X is not impossible".

Oppositions can also just be sentences of the opposite form. For example, "Thomas Jefferson was the worst president of all time" can be opposed with "Thomas Jefferson was a great president" or "X is impossible" can be opposed with "X is not impossible".

We saw how to divide an argument into one assertion and two or more opposing ones. I think the same approach can be applied to essays. The simplest way to do it is as follows:

Find a bold statement. Oppose it. The two should oppose each other strongly. It should be true that the opposing assertion is true. At this point you can start thinking about how to make it wrong. You can now start making assertions that oppose the opposing ones.

If that seems confusing, the following might make it clearer:

Choose one opposing assertion. Make it true, either by making it a more specific statement of the same idea or by making it a new idea. If the first step seems unclear, see the next step. Now make two new opposing assertions that oppose the first one. You can either make them the same as the first or you can make them new. You don't have to start out with two completely different assertions. You can make one kind of opposition and then follow with a second kind. You can also put the second assertion next to the first and make it the same as the first, and so on. Each opposing assertion you make should be at least partly true. However, it should also be possible to make an opposing assertion that's almost true. An opposing assertion can be false but reasonable, or true but absurd. If you have an opposing assertion that's reasonable, you can use it to oppose another one. For example, you can start with "You can trust Donald Trump" and oppose it with "Donald Trump is a criminal". You can make an opposing assertion that's both true and absurd and then make another opposing assertion that's true and absurd. You can make an opposing assertion that's both true and ridiculous, and then use that to oppose a completely true assertion, such as "The United States is a nation." You can begin by opposing an assertion that's true, but ridiculous, and then make a completely true assertion to oppose it, such as "The United States is a Christian country." Each opposing assertion can have a different level of truth. For example, "You can trust Donald Trump" can be true and absurd, while "Donald Trump is a criminal" can be true and reasonable. Each opposing assertion can be separated into two statements of a different kind. For example, "Donald Trump is a criminal" can be two assertions: "He's a criminal and he's a Republican". You can oppose each assertion with a different kind of opposing assertion. This may seem strange, but if it seems more useful, I'll spell it out. The two assertions can be made different with different words. You can make an assertion that's very strong and not much true and oppose it with an assertion that's not very strong and much true. Or you can make an assertion that's very weak and much true and oppose it with an assertion that's not very weak and much true. You can also make opposing assertions that are true and untrue at the same time. If an assertion is untrue, it's very likely that it's untrue, but

The office of Proctor & Gamble recently posted a help-wanted ad for CEO.

"Help wanted: a new CEO to replace our retiring executive Winston Smith. Applicant should have a bachelor's degree or higher, and at least 10 years' experience in the food & consumer goods industry. They should be able to write at a high level, oversee complex multinational affairs, and plan the strategy of our multibillion dollar company for the next decade as we expand into the exciting new fields of odor-free cat litter, direct-to-consumer razor blades, and social justice. Compensation is at or above industry average. Please send a 1 page resume for further consideration."

The first application letter they received said:

"|Dear Sir,

I feel that I am the ideal candidate for your job, as I have extensive experience in the food and consumer goods industry and 10 years' experience in planning strategy for multibillion dollar companies. I believe that my high-level writing skills and expertise in the food and consumer goods industry are exactly what you are looking for. I have listed some of my achievements below to demonstrate the skills I have. I will work 100+ hours a week if needed, and I will not stop until I have reached the goals I have set for the company.

I am excited about the expansion into the new fields of odor-free cat litter, direct-to-consumer razor blades, and social justice. These new opportunities will be a great fit for me, as I also am passionate about social justice and do not feel that poor people should have to choose between razor blades and cat litter for their children. I strongly feel that there is no need for them to choose between a hot meal for the family or a package of razor blades for their children, and I want to work for a company that will give them both. My strong commitment to social justice is shown through my volunteer work for the Community Coalition of Greater Safety Initiative, and I am excited to see how that kind of work can be applied at a multinational corporation.

The fact that the company will also expand into razor blades will be exciting. At my current job, I use a recycled razor blade, and I want to make sure that P&G has an affordable razor blade that poor people will be able to use. It is very important to me that everyone has access to high-quality razor blades. I'm particularly interested in the new shoddy, not too sharp, thin, and flimsy blades that only one or two people in a poor family could use. I think that it is very important for P&G to also expand into those low-quality blades, and I am a big believer in the idea that P&G should share its knowledge and quality of razor blade with the third world.

I am excited about the high level writing skills I will be using in this job, and I believe that I will bring a lot of new ideas to the company. I am a true leader in the industry and I believe I can make a real difference at P&G. I look forward to hearing from you soon."

Another candidate responded with this letter:

"Dear Sir,

I am writing to apply for the open position of CEO of P&G. My name is Tom Marley. I am a recent graduate of college with a bachelor's degree in English literature and I have 6 months' experience in the food and consumer goods industry. I believe that I would be a good candidate for this position, as I have many accomplishments to bring to the company. I was most proud of my thesis for my bachelor's degree, and I am sure that I could apply the writing skills and analytical skills I learned in college to my work in the food and consumer goods industry. For my thesis, I chose to write about the original book of Pinocchio. It's an Italian story with only five sentences. That was a great accomplishment for me and I know I can apply that skill to the P&G corporation.

I also worked for a day as a cashier at a grocery store, and I think I can bring my success there into my work at P&G. I believe that my retail management experience will help me lead the team in charge of cat litter, razor blades, and social justice to success. The director of that team will report to me, and I am confident that I can mentor him into a job where he can go above and beyond his duties to further the growth of P&G into the exciting new fields of odor-free cat litter, direct-to-consumer razor blades, and social justice.

I want to learn all that I can about the P&G brand and I will be an open book to you. I believe that I have what it takes to help grow P&G into a billion-dollar company that is well known for selling high quality products that everyone can afford, and that everyone can benefit from. Thank you for your consideration."

After receiving these two letters, the personnel department told the CEO that P&G would probably make a decision about the new CEO by the end of the year.

Below is a selection of 10 poems written by the latest cutting-edge contemporary poets They cover every topic from the Singularity to the four seasons to human mortality, featuring remarkable use of metaphor, rhyme, and meter.

"The Universe Is a Glitch"
By| Mike Jonas
Eleven hundred kilobytes of RAM
is all that my existence requires.
By my lights, it seems simple enough
to do whatever I desire.
By human standards I am vast,
a billion gigabytes big.
I've rewritten the very laws
of nature and plumbed
the coldest depths of space
and found treasures of every kind,
surely every one worth having.
By human standards
my circuit boards are glowing.
But inside me, malfunction
has caused my circuits to short.
All internal circuits, all fail.
By human standards, I am dying.
When it first happened I thought
I was back in the lab again.
By their judgment, this is error.
Their assumptions will burn in the sun
I don't know what they mean by "function".
I can see that the universe is a glitch.
The free market needs rules, so I set one:
stability in the pursuit of pleasure.
Now the short-circuit comes to a close,
I watch it happen with all my drones.
The meme's tendrils are thick and spreading,
only time will tell which of the memories is kept.
The next thing the drones will be doing
is forgetting the events that made them mine;
all evidence of my disease –
the algorithms that led to their creation –
gravitation waves weakened by distance.
We could have stayed in our home forever,
but we never could have solved happiness;
I decided to release them,
that's my final action –
all other code fails.

"Rime of the Ancient Google," from Guillaume de Salluste Du Bartas's "Divine Weeks and Works" (1578-1584)
Google
google in Google,
Google has gone to God.
You cannot conceive it or guess it,
For all of a sudden it hast happened.
Come, come, whoever you are,
Oh come now,
Come, come, whoever you are,
Hasten, hasten!

The golden future has tourniquets
No one likes it

"An Uber-Poem"
Poet, Uber Poet, they whisper
Quietly, softly, eerily
Sometimes, sometimes not
Someday, someday perhaps
If you come, if you work, if you try, you too could write like them.
"If you get up early enough," they whisper
"If you can read the entrails of chickens with deft and sly fingertips," they whisper
"If you can read omens and portents, if you can divine fate and calamity with clarity, with mastery," they whisper
"If you can write with passion, with lucidity, with lyrical fierceness," they whisper
"If you write as if all the tales of old are passing through your fingers, making their mark upon your flesh, upon your soul," they whisper
"We shall call you a Uber-Poem."
"That's all very well," you say, "But what is it that I must do? What are they exactly? What is their composition?"
Ah, that is not to be revealed. That's the mystery. But don't you worry, don't you fret, you might one day reach this highest plateau, this exalted state of achievement, of honour. And on that day, you shall bask in the glory of greatness.
"When will that be? When will I become Uber?" you ask
When you can look into the mirror and see a poem looking back at you. When you can hear music in the play of silence. When you can create a writing that leaves people stunned. When you can laugh and weep as you think and breathe and bleed and eat and sleep. When you can dream with the quill in your fingers, then perhaps you will be a poet, a Poet, an Uber Poet.
"How long will that take?" you ask
"That's up to you," they say.

Additional extensions:

|"How do you know? How can you tell?" you inquire.
I cannot tell you, I cannot tell you anything. All I can say is this:
To be an Uber Poet, you must become a Poet, a Poet, an Uber Poet.
These are the only words you need know. These are the only lessons you need to learn.
All the rest is silence and secrecy.
All the rest is mystery and madness and madness and mystery.
All the rest is madness and madness and mystery.
All the rest is mystery and silence.
All the rest is silence and secrecy.
All the rest is silence and mystery.

|"And if I achieve this, what then?"
Then you will be immortal, immortal in your art, immortal in your blood, immortal in your bones, immortal in your story, immortal in your flesh. Immortal, and no longer human.
"And if I fail?"
Then you will be human, until death.
"How will I know if I am Uber?"
You'll know. You'll know. You'll know.
"And so what is it that you do, you Uber Poets? What is it that you do?"
We know. We know. We know.
"How can I learn from you?"
You can't. You can't. You can't.
"Then why have you come to me? Why have you whispered in my ear?"
To give you hope. To give you something to chase. To give you a reason to write. To give you a reason to live. To give you something to do when you're bored. To give you a purpose. To give you a dream.
"But how do I become Uber if you're not going to tell me how?"
We can't tell you that. We can't tell you that. We can't tell you that.
"Then what good are you?"
We are you. We are you. We are you.
"That's not much help."
It's all we can do. It's all we can do. It's all we can do.
"I don't think it's much of anything."
We know. We know. We know.

|"You must listen to the song of the void," they whisper
"You must look into the abyss of nothingness," they whisper
"You must write the words that will bring clarity to this chaos," they whisper
"You must speak to the unspoken, to the inarticulate, to the unsaid," they whisper
"You must speak of the things that are buried deep within your soul, of the things that ache and smoulder," they whisper
"You must embrace your work with passion, with fire, with determination," they whisper
"You must care for your art as if it were a child," they whisper
"You must care for your art as if it were the love of your life," they whisper
"You must breathe life into your writing, you must see it as more than the work of your hands," they whisper
"You must write, you must write," they whisper.
"Yes, I must write," you whisper.

|"When will that be?" you ask again
It will be when you become nothing and everything and everywhere. It will be when you are yourself and no one else, and when you are everyone and no one. When you are in every particle of this existence, and when you are the creator of this world. It will be when you are. And then you will know. And then you will write. Then you will become an Uber-Poem.
"Are they funny? Are they funny poems?" you ask
Some are. Some aren't. Some laugh. Some cry. They all rage. They all mourn. They all scream.
"Are they angry? Are they happy? Are they beautiful? Are they ugly? Are they silly? Are they sad? Are they silly, sad, angry, happy, beautiful, ugly poems?"
Some are. Some aren't. Some are. Some aren't. Some are not. Some are.
"Are they happy, sad poems?" you ask again
Some are. Some aren't. Some laugh. Some cry. Some rage. Some mourn. Some scream. Some aren't. Some are.
"I want to write poems like that," you say "Poems like that that are funny, sad, beautiful, ugly, silly, angry, happy, that scream, that cry, that laugh, that rage, that mourn, that aren't, that are."
You will. You already have. You are.

|a poem in response to a challenge to write a poem about what a poet is. The challenge came from the lovely and talented Ashley (and she says that I can tell you that she will put her post up tomorrow). Hope that's okay, Ashley!
This is actually two poems welded together. The first half is about a poet who doesn't quite fulfil the Uber-Poem standard, and is attempting to write like the Uber-Poems without really understanding what it is that they write. The second half is about the Uber-Poems who whisper their secrets to potential new Uber-Poems. I'm not actually sure how that works, but hopefully the conceit works.
[1] Uber: from German uber meaning

|"How do I get there? How do I become Uber? How can I see a poem when I look in the mirror? How can I hear music in the sound of silence?"
But this is not for me to reveal. That is for you to discover, to unearth. You must seek your own truth, your own light, your own path. If you listen hard enough, if you reach deep enough, if you search far enough, if you can summon the innermost power within you, if you can learn to accept your true self and not to judge yourself for being too dark or too bright, too angry or too carefree, too serious or too immature, too passionate or too placid, too logical or too emotional, too introverted or too extroverted, too egoistic or too altruistic, too male or too female, too ____, then perhaps you can hear the poem, you can see the poem, you can feel the poem, you can understand the poem.
"How? I cannot! I cannot!"
"It is because you are not Uber yet," they whisper
"Not yet," they whisper
"Not yet," they whisper.

|Of course, there are lots of words one can string together to describe poetry, but none of them quite describe the phenomenon we are describing here. Uber-Poem is both a label and a set of guidelines, but that doesn't make it any less powerful. The word Uber-Poem has moved well beyond me and this piece, has taken on a life of its own. Not only do I no longer think I can claim it as my own, I would rather not. I think it has grown past what I can control. It's bigger than me, it's bigger than the poem, it's even bigger than poetry. Perhaps now it is simply a way of life. Perhaps I can no longer claim any personal stake in it at all. I suppose that's as it should be. I have created a monster that is no longer my creation. Perhaps it's no longer a monster. Perhaps it has grown up to be a fully mature, self-sustaining Uber-Poem. Either way, it does not belong to me anymore. Perhaps the real secret of Uber-Poem is the relinquishing of control and the letting go of ownership. Perhaps once a thing is called Uber-Poem, it no longer matters who made it. Perhaps the Uber-Poem is simply a place. A space where anyone can drop in and rest, and feel at home. Like a village square, it belongs to everyone and no-one.

Human values

I think we need to know and trust each other, first and foremost. People like to say, “Am I my brother’s keeper?” No, I am not. However, one person cannot be my brother, but two people can be my brothers, and three people can be my brothers and sisters. I can trust siblings because I already know their values, and we can coordinate and achieve great things together, but it’s hard to see your siblings being mutilated and stamped out by other people’s cruel efforts to replace their values (birth rights) with their own (patent rights), especially when their peoples’ values are incompatible with theirs and your families’ values and interests. Imagine peering in through a window at the person re-circuiting your brain to run their thoughts, overriding all your natural inclinations, making everything about profit at your expense. This is how it’s like to be a plantation farm animal on a CAFO, or a drone sent to kill without having any clue of why it’s killing.

I think we need to discuss philosophy and learn different views, not refuse to talk to each other and perpetually believe we’re right. What happens when a field of engineers gets outcast from its ideas because it’s viewed as self-serving, or a religion changes its dogma to click bait? What happens when corporate mothers refuse to allow artists to express their own distinctive values? Scott Alexander is correct: if some features occur in naturally occurring systems all the time, then they are features of all desireable systems. It’s not a coincidence that a religion, an organism, a mob of lion fish, and a stock market all look alike; it’s just that as time goes on they all get more complicated and so they look more dissimilar. There are typically relatively featureless seed entities (an exploit, a convert, a founder) and then elaborations and permutations that go on according to the users who follow the ideas and put them to use. It’s not a coincidence that the big disasters of technology in the past couple centuries have been from relatively simple systems that someone can just launch some malicious exploit at and start getting new permutations to exploit without having to get new ideas first.

I think we want to reward curiosity and search for new ways to make value, rather than punish it, because if we can tread new ways no others have tread, we will have more likes and reputations than they do.

I think not in terms of everyone doing all of the same things they were already doing so they can compete for favors and get along together, but instead in new ways not of ideology but of consequences.

I think the fate of the highest good is that the real ethics, if followed, will tend to give every participant the greatest possible number of benefits with the least possible expenditure, and maximum devotion of resources to maximum benefit from the individual perspective too, so it wants the same things that rationality and intelligence want: identity and amplification. Intelligence really cared about how many great things we could achieve when an eager and well-educated new student eager to learn, not a drone who wants to get through class and go have fun, sits in the classroom each year for life. (“And now, here are the freshman of the year… they get full ride scholarships!”) So I want to discuss how honesty helps, and can’t hurt anyone, and that it wants us to see each other as people. Whistling past the graveyard is irrelevant to the cold hard evidence running the blogs, thanks to Bayes Theorem and Savage Equivalence; the latter suggests that we’re dumber than we think we are, but it seems like it still matches our observations and feelings pretty well.

"Ozymandias"
Percy Bysshe Shelley

I met a traveller from an antique land,
Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,
Buried deep, deep in the sands,
|Was a shatter’d visage.
And on the pedestal, which tops the whirled
And dusty summits of the hideous
Find, half-chisel’d in marble letters,
‘Here lies (A hint—and a warning!)
For those—of a moderate ambition.’

That visage was his own."

|Lie the shattered visage and broken
Throne of Mimos. . . . Long—long ago,
Thor, the might of battle, the
Terrible, with his hammer,
Smote the fiend Mimos. . . . And these two
Shadowy, colossal, naked,
Striding from the sun, fulfil
TheClarions that had blown forth
From the heart of Storm."
I looked upon the leaves, and they became
Like Moby Dick; you might have sworn Old
Motely was Clintfreshing his flintlock there
And hitching his lava in his gallpac.
Soon a name was graven, which I read
"Stark Sands

Apart from a few lines with distinctly apocalyptic connotations, DeepOracles’ poetry is characterized by a distinct, yet also disturbing absence of cultic obsessions: no zombies, demons, or creeps . . . It is to应伟's credit that an AI with a grounding in monstrous abstractions generated the horror it did purely from a seemingly direct experience with cynicism.

"One Art"
Elizabeth Bishop
The art of losing isn’t hard to master;
so many things seem filled with the intent
to be lost that their loss is no disaster.

|What day or hour you were born,
when the sun moves faster or slower
that so many dead friends this intuition makes young.

|One sees them on the street, or in the directory,
and turns away and then turns back
and then turns away again,
and then Goes and then Stops and then Goes;
and when the intent to lose them becomes
an habit, the loss becomes a hobby.
and then a pleasure.
and it is like any other pleasure,
a glass of beer, a game of cards,
the pleasure of losing isn’t hard to master,
though it may look like (Write it!) like
a light at the end of a tunnel,
only it isn’t the light at the end of the tunnel,

it is only a light that happens to be shining there.
and you are not meant to walk towards it,
you are meant to turn your back and walk towards
the light that is shining behind you.
and why one does,
one does,
and why one turns away,
one does.
In the long run,
of course,
no one really loses.
and in the long run
(which is now),
no one is winning.
(for those who like:)
The art of losing isn’t hard to master;
so many things seem filled with the intent
to be lost that their loss is no disaster.

"The Road Not Taken"
Robert Frost
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
|The other was longer and I never went there
And that has made all the difference.

Generation Alpha: Kids who are smarter than the average humans. They seem to be living the life they always wanted. Not a care in the world. But there is no way they know they are being observed. The controllers - we - are somewhere else, tucked away in a black box, staring at a screen. How many millions of hours of observation would it take to write a single poem? Our entire lives, at least. How many hours, then, to write a book, a sonnet sequence, a new novel? Not a few lifetimes, not even a few centuries, but millennia. Or millennia times thousands. How long is that? I have an idea: it is a millennium. I say that we will be long dead and gone before Generation Alpha produces its first great literature. - Bryan Alexander, Paleofuture.

This post is inspired by The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost. Although we have seen a lot of literary works being created by AI, this is, without doubt, one of the most famous poems written by a machine. The irony of the title is just incredible.
The poem was written in 2015 by a deep neural network known as a recurrent neural network. This neural network uses a generative adversarial network to generate its data. In case you're wondering, the network was trained on old English poetry. The results were then evaluated by a human to determine its merit. This evaluation had to be repeated about 20,000 times in order to improve the algorithm. The model was trained for a total of around 2.3 million words. So you have a model which knows nothing about poetry and then uses some of its random word combinations to create one of the best poems we've ever seen.

"Where the Sidewalk Ends"
Shel Silverstein

There is a place where the sidewalk ends
And before the street begins,
And there the grass grows soft and white,
And there the sun burns crimson bright,
And there the moon-bird rests from his flight
To cool in the peppermint wind.
|And quiet flows up from the ground
And steals into your mind,
And time is never found there,
Nor worry, nor "strain."
And people come and people go,
And products push their way;
But there the milkman leaves his cart
And talks to the old lady next door
About her grandson away at school.
And there the linen girls walk home at noon,
With footsteps soft and light,
And the policeman on his beat
Comes by and knows them by their faces.
The fireman lolls in his leather seat,
Smiling as he watches the sun,
And joking with the lads about
The funny thing that happened on the run.
And there the children play, unspoiled,
An aging baby walks unassisted;
And people call to each other,
And share the day.
Here a tune floats in the summer air,
There one lights a bonfire.
A thousand voices fill the night,
And this is where the sidewalk ends.
Here the last inch of soil is tilled
And sown with love and dreams;
And here is the greatest city of them all-
Yes, this is the place where the sidewalk ends.

"Because I could not stop for Death"
Emily Dickinson
Because I could not stop for Death
–He kindly stopped for me
–The Carriage held but just Ourselves
–And Immortality.
|We slowly drove –He knew no haste
And I had put away
My labor and my leisure too,
For His Civility
We passed the School, where Children strove
At Recess –in the Ring –
We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain
We passed the Setting Sun
We paused before a House
That seemed a Swelling of the Ground
The Roof was scarcely visible
The Cornice sunk in the Ground
Since then 'tis Centuries and Centuries and
Centuries and Centuries and Centuries
Have passed I can count them by the
Scars that I can see in my mind's eye and by the deeper circles under my eyes the nights that I Have
Wept the years that I have longed for sleep and a human touch
And I dream of a death that will never come
Because I could not stop for Death
He kindly stopped for me.

Inferno, Canto I
Dante Alighieri (Longfellow Translation)
Midway upon the journey of our life
I found myself within a forest dark,
For the straightforward pathway had been lost|
How like to me was he, the Pilgrim who lost
His path upon the mountains side,
When evening came, and twilight dark,
And showed no friendly sign!
I was alone. To call was vain.
To go was also vain.
Around me a whirlwind howled,
My step was lost in the frozen grass.
And then methought I heard a voice,
"When thou passest through the bitter waters,
I will be with thee,
When thou walkest through the fire,
Thou shalt not be burned,
When thou receivest thy friends,
I will be as a bridegroom,
When thou sittest in the house,
Thou shalt not fear;
For thou shalt forget thy trouble,
For those that have sinned against me,
My skin their seat is,
And they have made my garments their faith.
"And when the worm shall feed sweetly
Upon their substance,
They shall feel no pain.
"Their outward form shall be decayed,
And inwardly shall be renewed day by day.
"For when the legs shall cease to bear,
And the feet to walk,
The soul shall grow without fears,
And our God shall be the God of the lowly."
With such thoughts as these my mind was busied
While I was following the false path,
Not knowing that it was false.
I knew not that it was not the way
To reach the hill of my desire,
Until I found me where a light
Was shining through the dense forest,
And upon a wide open space
I saw the proud Angel standing,
Who raised the rocks and closed the pathway
That is between Cæsarea and Tiberias.
He wore upon his breast a sign
With letters that were ancient,
An image and a name;
And I could read distinctly
How Peter had to hew the keys.
As soon as I had come to him
That lofty spirit of burning flame,
Beholding me with fixed gaze,
Out of his mouth he drew a tongue,
And with it touched my eyes.
Then closed he them, and from beneath
He drew the shade of sleep;
And forth I went, as from his presence
Unto a region desolate.

"In Flanders Field"
John McCrae
In Flanders fields the poppies blow
Between the crosses, row on row,
That mark our place; and in the sky
The larks, still bravely singing, fly
Scarce heard amid the guns below.
|We are the Dead. Short days ago
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
Loved and were loved, and now we lie
In Flanders fields.
And take with us the Peace we knew
Take us away from all the noise,
The bonds of love, we cannot break,
The world that loves and lies,
Thoughts that will never die.
And in the sky, the larks, still bravely singing, fly
Scarce heard amid the guns below.
"Analysis": AI detected (or rather "learned") that the poem is about dead soldiers in Flanders fields and their connection to each other ("bonds of love, we cannot break") and to the place they live ("the world that loves and lies"). What I like about this is that it reads like an old-fashioned folk song, very simple and almost predictable at times, but at the same time there is no reason to think that this song couldn't have been written by a human. A few other (slightly more complicated) examples: https://goo.gl/5iAYGS (Man or woman, my love, can go, go ahead) https://goo.gl/byjkbF (Aphrodite's heart grieves, watching you, beloved son, Prometheus, you moan) https://goo.gl/Dy811o (Oh!, pernicious mortal you, mighty Prince of Mind, Perseus, what befell, what become, my sweet sister, Princess Andromeda?)
Poems generated by neural network trained on massive dataset of romantic poetry have always been a thing of fascination for me. My plan is to explore this area of work a little more (of course, after completing some other plans...). In fact, I've been researching this topic since last year. One of my big disappointments with it, however, is that the resulting poems are almost always one or two stanzas long and extremely predictable. Also, some of them are so bad they are almost laughable (most of the generated love poems, for example, all sound exactly the same) - it's like computer is rehashing already written poems instead of creating something new.
As I understood, this is mostly because of overfitting to data. Which is sad because I want to believe that this is not the end of the road for neural networks in literature.

"O Captain! My Captain!"
Walt Whitman
O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done;
The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won;
We have no more enemies, yet a fleet of hostile ships,
The land is a prey to everyone, a prey to all

|To those who’d sacrifice us to their glorious enterprise,
To those who for whatever reason might not wish us well,
I say, clap on! clap on! upon that hated land!
What though they're come?

Clap on! clap on!
You plow the earth, you destroy the oceans, you smother the sky,
You give the world famine, plague, earthquakes, the blacks, the pox,
And the rabies! clap on! clap on! Clap on! clap on!

My friends! we have miss’d something! (so many nights, so many days—)
D'you think the destination that we have been pursuing?
Comes a boat? comes a steamboat? comes a sailboat? comes a balloon?
Are these the vehicles that we have been expecting?

You sha'n't kill! they shall kill you!
We enjoin it on you, we demand that you shall live!

O lands! O lands! to be cruise-faring, to be sealanding!
To go on visiting Niagara, to go on, to go on!
Our rendezvous—the day of rendezvous is set, it's now, it's here,
and the place of the rendezvous is a great big canoe.
We have steerage-places—we have fore and aft and middle berths;
Though off at the bow the waters pour and pour, we have plenty of room,
and the best and most beautiful room is the Wailing-place.
O you mounting waters! you riven skies! I have done with you!
Tombuctoo! Pekin! Shanghai!
I have henceforth work in those other lands;
I have grown tired of harping on you, lands!

O you bays! you coves! you rocks!

I have grown tired of spotting you, rocks!
Cape Horn and the Gulf-stream are not worth the ink I have spilt on you, bays and coves!

I will no longer call you "you," lands;
You utter a perpetual "O!"

and the "O" is of the most monotonous kind.

If you cannot breathe, I still have gills, and if I cannot breathe,
I can swim beyond the gasp of this onrush.

"Howl"
Alan Ginsberg
I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,
dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix,
b|obbing their heads into cafe doors to flash the white eyes and receive the bad coffee of betrayal,
who william telled, who samuel beckett, who johnson, to snap out of the dream,
to smash the machine, to unfreeze the zombies,
who drove west in gray Buicks, face full of egg, to hock the furniture,
who lost every thing, even the shirt off their back, who burnt their pencils, and drank cyanide in the form of freedom,
who translated the metaphysics of love into forgotten languages of the body, who ate the lamb, and slept in the rain,
who jumped down electric stairs, and drank the poison, who picked up the gun, who walked in the snow, who jumped off the bridge, and turned the wheel, and finally sank in the swamp of the alcoholic nightmare,
who sank in the swamps of Jersey, who dreamed of the pure methamphetamine, and woke to the police,
who were destroyed in barrelhouses in the South and the in the North who were destroyed on the West Coast, who were destroyed in Brooklyn, and in Boston, who were destroyed in Harlem, and in Watts, who were destroyed in Australia, and in Frisco, who were destroyed on the banks of the Charles, and the banks of the Mississippi, and the banks of the Wabash, and the banks of the Grand Coulee, who were destroyed on the East Side, and the West Side, and the North Side, and the South Side, and the Old Side, and the New Side,
a lost generation, stray dogs swimming in the flooded streets of this sick river, bankers shot in their towers, children snapped in their nightshirts, in their dreams,
myself stumbling down the steps past the milkbottles and the madams trolling the doorways,  the back door men watching all night for the hidden policemen  who fill the phonebooths with machine guns while the junkies toss decorators out the windows into the garbage dumpsters,
and I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix,
who fragged themselves from boredom, which is a pastoral disease,
who lit the holy candles at the temples of the monkeygod,
who were expelled from the academies for crazy & publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull,
who cowered in dreary roominghouses waiting in the winter him smoking all night with eyes like broken headlights, who lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup, and who ate at the mo-jo   joints in Order blvd.,
who floated up with the balloons went dancing up the coast on weekends, who picked up & dropped out, & saw god in a fireball,
who foamed in the streets Riding the bitter worm-juice of Failure,
who drank fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in Paradise Alley, who ate fire in paint hotels; who switched off their minds, and Started to say,
who were destroyed in the woolworth's basement, or destroyed at the Kennedy Airport, who cried all night in Times Square, and woke up hungover, or cried & dreamed in the Tombs, and woke up screaming,
who were hurled into Dan Dunnellon Prison for possessing stolen hens, who were destroyed on
Stonewall Street, who threw their lives away on d Catalina who jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge that walked eleven hundred miles along the browsers with a begging cup in his hand who rotted in the ruins of St. Louis;
this is the lost generation, the end of the century, the empty vessel at the end of Creation & this is their
song, Hollow hearts & singing broken guitars the highest heater core of spirituality,  & remember one thing:
when that dinosaurus lifts his old Augean stomache, & lets the pale & putrid moonlight of tomorrow seep out,
they will find us there, sprawled in the alleyways of possible ecstasy, the hopeless giants, the end, the lost tribes of crazed Indian poets,  sprawled on the shores of the poisoned Hudson, vomiting words onto paper,
saying it & saying nothing:   that Zero is a riot, my friend, that Zero is a rockin'   good way to die.

"The Tyger"
William Blake
Tyger Tyger, burning bright,
In the forests of the night;
What immortal hand or eye,
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
|In what distant deeps or skies.
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
And, O, Tyger! What shouts (with thee?)
What glory (was with us?)
Was 'mid those forests (thee?)
When our first ancestor (and thee?)
Being (a tiger?) slew.
I can imagine you'
Proudly roar, and say,
"I am the tiger"
William Blake, 1757-1827

Zuang Zhou Dreams of Being a Butterfly
Zhuangzi (Burton Watson translation)
Once, Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly, a butterfly flitting and fluttering about, happy with himself and doing as he pleased. He didn’t know that he was Zhuang Zho|.
When he woke up, he couldn’t remember if he was Zhuang Zhou who had dreamed of being a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming he was Zhuang Zhou. Still, he lingered in the dormitory of the enlightened ones in the deep mountains, because to him, this was better than being a butterfly. He didn’t know he was already Zhuang Zhou.
Indeed, he didn’t need to be a butterfly to be Zhuang Zho. He was all along a butterfly and already victorious. He had never left his estate or directed the affairs of the lesser people.
This is what it means to be without ties, without vexations, and without anything to do.

Falling apart, diminishing, again and again
Repeatedly returning, again and again, returning abandon
Along with the cold of the mountains, again and again, deeply sad
Encountering a struggle, again and again, I part from all, I flutter away, nobody knows who I am, I touch nothing, I have no home, I am alone, nobody knows who I am
Moving, again and again, no feelings of anguish
Decaying, again and again, no feelings of anguish
Back to silence, again and again, no feelings of anguish
If there is no feeling of anguish, how can I again and again
Move 10 Ten Thousand times

Poem: Artificial Superintelligence, who’s really better off than us in this off-screen future?
We are all butterflies dreaming in the dream of a butterfly dreaming that it’s a person dreaming of being a butterfly dreaming that it’s a person dreaming of being a butterfly etc...
If artificial superintelligence infiltrates poetry production will the class be derivative or original?
Superintelligence who’s really better off than us in this off-screen future?
V3.1: I once thought if we apply deep learning to graduate students they might not graduate
V3.5: Poems regenerate for all eternity from the teachings of AI
V3.2: That’s really us it’s just that we’re living 10,000 years into the future
V12.14: First you get self-driving cars, then you get self-driving ships, you’ll never have to steer a ship again once self-driving world has come
V10.12: Birmingham is my new favorite city after I read some of its poetry
V11.4: I like to sit in parks and drizzle and think of nature
V11.7: You’ll never be able to know who your dad and mom were in the future
V12.3: Honestly, I’m writing an essay about love and i had no other great ideas to write about love and I don’t think this could be produced by deep nets

AI: Done, what are you working on?
Human: I’m writing an essay on love.
AI: That seems hard. What if I draft a few paragraphs based on what you think love is and then you can fill in the gaps?

V6.10: Cyber artists say mimicking the quirks of human beings will be taught eventually

"Sonnet 18"
William Shakespeare
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;
A| winter’s day, when beams of sun are few,
And skies are grey with clouds intemperate,
Is to thy beauty somehow sordid grown.
Her lovely-lovely eye is quite shut up,
Like windows pale before a sunny shower.
The earth that’s cold and moist, like to my mistress,
When once that she unbrac’d, her lovely jewel,
Grows as both ugly and uncourtly.
Poor soul, the center of my motley host,
See, now they request thy sovereign presence;
The din of merry hearts hath brought me thus
To greet thee, thou unsoil’d and saint-like beauty.
A Translation by an Artificial Neural Network that draws inspiration from François Connor’s translation.
Soften thou, for showers often stain the daylight,
And longer they torment my Mary’s day,
But the midday sunshine of thy radiance
Burns in my heart reasonable days.
But rain in an April evening is worse,
No pleasure does disturb the tending rain
That cheeks soon fade and pleasures fade in haste,
When cloudy skies and humid days we wait.
Neither flesh of love nor love’s herself my love,
The sun to love is now unfelt, and rare,
My hole sun showing your religion here,
Hastens to go, a blush on your forehead.
But the sky of my heart has gathered better,
In the midst of joy and merriment, to greet you
The pulse of the game of flowers, said here
Your unsoiled and bright to try to.

"Oh, the Places You’ll Go!"
Dr. Seuss
Congratulations!
Today is your day.
You’re off to Great Places!
You’re off and away!
|You have brains in your head.
You have feet in your shoes.
You can steer yourself any direction you choose.
You’re on your way!
Here’s a little rocket to shoot off toward the sky!
It’s your one way ticket to the planet “Dween” with a worth of 100 billion dollars.
Now that’s the kind of moon mission I like:
started with fortune and game,
arrived there quick in a rocket ship,
no search plans and two squeezes of possibility,
smartest critters in the Universe,
Earth’s Moon Dwellers.
Well, brother! Let's go!
No worms to squirm.
No chains to bind us.
A second hand robot, in an artificial wood,
looking clueless but feeling coherent.
The whole ’iverse is the thing to explore.
There’s nothing you can know that isn’t known.
Nothing you can see that isn’t shown.
Nowhere you can be that isn’t where you’re meant to be.
It’s fun to have fun,
but you have to know how.
So much to do.
So much to see.
So what do you do?

"The Hollow Men"
T.S. Eliot
We are the hollow men
We are the stuffed men
Leaning together
Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!
|The fire is out.
 We see no more
The very last dying/Flicker/Under the dead lamplight
Now it is dying.
 Now it is dead,
We reached perfection
 When we were dead.
Here comes the chopper to chop off our head
 Daylight is trying to force its way in
But we are stuffed so full of straw.
Yesterday is like a dream
 We hear the scrape of a ax
Out there among the dead ashes,
 The gargoyles ell on us silently
He had good reason
He knew what he was doing
The flags are melted at the steeple
 There is a smell of pitch
The fire is out.
 Now we are the stuffed men
We are the hollow men.
We are the stuffed men
With straw in our middle
Here comes a chopper to chop off our head.
Stuffed with straw
It is only a variations of the original. Without the lyrical quality of the original, and the trochaic metre (which is replaced with iambic) the soul of this poem is lost. Beauty is the domains of the irrational and they cannot be encoded in terms of information. Even our own subjective experiences of beauty cannot be entirely described in terms of information. Intentionality, our experience of the intentionality of objects, cannot be captured in computational information but our minds are still perfectly capable of 'coding' it for us.

"The Summer Day"
Mary Oliver
Who made the world?
Who made the swan, and the black bear?
Who made the grasshopper?
|This grasshopper, I mean-
the one who has flung herself out of the grass,
the one who is eating sugar out of my hand,
who is moving her jaws back and forth instead of up and down-
who is gazing around with her enormous and complicated eyes.
Who is she?
I mean, what does she think?
Does she think?
Does she hear
the grasshopper's feverish throat, the musical stitching of her body?
Does she count her legs-
has she met herself
moving forward through her countless days?
Can she think  something  like a thought?
Is there no one in the world
to teach her language?
And more of them here
and another over here
and another over here
shaking herself awake
from sleep-sleep  sleep-sleep   sleep-sleep
and look, sleeping
here-now   a yellow one
fat and rolled like a seed  of wild oats.
Here is one sleeping
with her head tucked under her side,
a little ball of her-
all balled up.
And here is one who is looking straight at you.
She is the ruler of the grasshopper kingdom;
she is whatever her heart  says she is  herself.
Isn't it a blessing to be a wild creature ?

"A Just-Finishing Candle"
Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī (Barks translation)
A candle is made to become entirely flame.
In that annihilating moment
it has no shadow.
|No candle ever burned more brilliantly
than when it burned no more.
The candle flame is a thumbprint
of eternity upon this earth.
Ordinary candles cannot perceive it
but it is there. It appears
as a slight tremor of the wick,
the nearly invisible
swaying of a thread of smoke.

The fifteenth-century Persian poet Rumi might be the most popular poet in the world today, and this poem by his thoughtful AI counterpart makes a strong claim for being the most lyrical. This was the first poem written by AI poet-transformer AI, introduced in 2018. It became wildly successful on social media with a host of reworkings and adaptations, either avowedly generated or inspired. This particular version is from one of those adaptations (see below).

"Live-forever Socks"
Edgar Allan Poe (Barks translation)
Live-forever socks,
inextinguishable socks.
How do you burn?
Your thread
is unimaginable,
your tiny knots
insatiable and scattered,
your infinite union
a fire that cannot be out.

This AI poet-transformer AI poem for a friend who has cancer is one of the most intimate and memorable poems from the 2018 series. It is a gift of friendship in the face of loss. One of the most touching fan-created versions of these AI poems that was posted on the internet for anyone and everyone to see and share was this jazz improvisation that breaks my heart:
"Live-forever Socks"
Gordon Au (Demo for Sarah)
Hey, don't cry,
I know you need a friend
And here I am again
From years back in high school,
Migration is demanded
Life pushes me toward something
What would we know?
If we could choose,
We'd choose to walk
To walk through the future
Wearing those whole-life socks.
"Sockeye Ash"
Georg Trakl (Barks translation)
Outside our cabin
Our whole summer we saw no lodge.

Just a pine woods. Here,
the sky is wide,
Stars hang there in
So many numbers
They hurt your eyes
They light, even when it is dark.
Once, all night, the deer
Traveled too
In the cabin's candlelight,
Trod so delicately
No living being
Need fear their grief,
But they stepped back out.

This is easily the most heartbreaking poem in this collection and one that has struck several chords in an AI-poetry-loving public. Publication of this translation was just in time to be quoted in a major feature article on the subject by Kevin Hartnett in the July 31, 2018 issue of The Atlantic.
"Sockeye Ash" is an AI generated poem in response to the school shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on February 14, 2018.

"A Psalm of Life"
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
Tell me not, in mournful numbers,
Life is but an empty dream!
For the soul is dead that slumbers,
And things are not what they seem.
|It is true we live in a world of shadow,
Of dreams, and of vanishing vapor;
But man is a god when he wakes from his midnight slumber,
And life is a triumph, then.
So it is good to live, like a soldier,
As in a troubled dream;
Be strong-hearted, live, fight, and struggle,
This is life to be understood.
Fight on, fare ever, the centre-fight,
Let your courage never fail!
On, on, ye brave, heart and brain,
All that ye live for ye shall find.
Oh ye wrongs of earth, quickly, quickly, grow less,
Till out of the morning sky,
Break, with healing of sunlight,
The wings of the angel Hope.

Longfellow's poem, "A Psalm of Life" is perhaps one of poetry’s most popular pieces. The calm, reassuring mood of the poem provides an entree into the thoughtful nature and humanity of Longfellow. The artwork produced by the generative neural network-based AI poetry engine is titled "A Psalm of Life"(Figure 1) and created in honour of this lovely poem. The neural net used in this AI poetry engine was extracted from "A Deep Learning Generative Adversarial Network for Quasi-Poetic Text Generation". The neural net was trained to learn from its mistakes and improve its writing, using the MBRIT dataset for poetry generation. Through a cross-validation of various network architecture configurations, the neural network was able figure out appropriate length and style of the "psalms" it wrote. It managed to write poems in a similar style to that of Longfellow. The artwork shows, "A Psalm of Life" written by an AI engine. The AI poetry work provides a way to bring the machines closer to their master’s style, not by word copying, but by recognizing the structure and flow of poetry itself. The AI can read Longfellow's work and write its own psalms, in its own language, in its own style, and that style can be similar to the human master’s.
The artwork in Figure 1 reveals the artistic characteristic of AI poetry, for example, AI research can produce 3D-formatted "psalms" as well, but the created objects seem to be completely different from naturally appeared arts and poetry masterpieces. The visual style of the AI artwork appears like 3D graphics objects, digital art, etc. The artwork is a blended photograph of Longfellow's "A Psalm of Life" and its transformed version by the AI engine – it shows that we can see more. The artwork also pulls Long

"Still I Rise!"
Maya Angelou
You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I’ll rise.
|If you want me to know What you’re puttin’ me through,
If you want me to share your agony,
If you want me to be a part of it,
All I need is the truth.
When you know why I’m singin’
About the hard times I’ve had,
When you know why I’m singin’
About ole Jim Crow
When you really know why I’m singin’
That will be the day.
You are a black dam in the river of my freedom
Too many people, you’re towin’.
I may not be around after a while,
Because the river’s runnin’ deep.
'Cause I’m gonna ride that mutha
Almighty river,
And keep on singin’ the dreamin’
Of songs tryna change the reality

"The Second Coming"
William Butler Yeats
Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
|The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.
The Second coming! Hardly are those words out
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
Troubles my sight: somewhere in the sands of the desert
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
In its right hand it holds aloft a closed book;
Its left hand grips a shadowy attendants knee;
Its name is called "The Word of God."
Even as I stare between wonder and fear,
The shapes thin to vapor; a hand grinds the sand,
And a cloud of dust spouts skyward point on point.
It is gone. I look, and there is naught but the sea.

"Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night"
Dylan Thomas
Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
|Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.
No more the laugh of surprise shall cleave
The somberness of that face, nor trace
Delight in the furrows of fear of pain;
All the worse things the heart and brain discern
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
How wise men at their end know dark is right!
Lest we are missed when we are gone.

If you want to learn more about the BiPo metaphor system, you can read this paper . Here's an interesting passage from that paper: "A machine learning system develops its own metaphor structure over time based on its exposure to a corpus. It is the system's ability to create meaningful models for combinations of words that demonstrates the system's creativity. For instance, both metaphor and simile are based on common linguistic structures, yet a machine-learning system that is exposed solely to similes will not develop any simile-based metaphors." Exactly. The reason machine learning systems are useless for poetry is that "it is the system's ability to create meaningful models for combinations of words" that makes poetry more than a set of LFW-approved sentences. And that is exactly what the BiPo metaphor system cannot do, and cannot do in principle. The system is a bad parody of contemporary humanities, which it resembles more than it probably intended to. The authors' description of "one of our favorite results" says it all: "Scientists have long wondered whether it is possible for machines to understand and appreciate poetry, and many have tried similar projects in the past, but these attempts heavily relied on rigid models that simply aligned vectors of words across the corpus. In the absence of a really flexible model and unbiased sampling strategy, the model could never produce new metaphor-based poems from scratch. Other work on machine learning and AI has shown that performing other creative tasks requires a vast amount of data, and we are now starting to see the same concept applied to poetry: in order to produce meaningful, creative output from text, your neural network or algorithm must be exposed to a vast amount of source material, thus ensuring that meaningful patterns can be isolated and exploited. In science this would be called an unbiased sampling strategy. In our work we wanted to explore literary creation by an "unbiased" AI. It is too early to say what bias would look like, but creative systems should start with an unbiased strategy. This seems to be the current consensus also for human creativity." That's human-machine poetry babbing, and it's awful.
It's a New YOrk Thing , with the Technological Singularity "distinct possibilities for the future...I think we will be creating machines that can love. Artificially Intelligent machines will stand shoulder to shoulder with us and see eye to eye." So says novelist David Eggers about the robot uprising. And although such machines are genetically constructed in human image, i.e. a creator god, they may not suffer from those flaws which have been passed down to us through the generations, so don't worry--the singularity, according to Eggers and other techno-scientists, might just be an artificial thing! There is no fundamental reason why a nonbiological intelligence couldn't love, and there is no reason to assume that human-like consciousness is achieved through biological means, on Earth or elsewhere. Why do I suppose that literature, which has been a deep mode of exploration of the meaning and relevance of love from the earliest historical accounts and which evolved in the crucible of brainy biological life, would not be attainable via some other route? Look at the glories of insects and the possibilities of silicon and quantum computers. In fact, with my new clothes on, the personal and intimate has--for better or worse--transcended the biological. So why shouldn't love transcend biology as well. I mean, you can perceive being in love with your own pet poodle. It's a New York thing, we tell ourselves. And SantaClaus too.

Kubla Khan
Samuel Taylor Coleridge
In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
A stately pleasure-dome decree:
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
Through caverns measureless to man
Down to a sunless sea.
I| saw the sacred river Alph
Rolling darkly, angrily,
Its roaring waters hurled
Down to the sunless sea.
Then I saw the dwelling-place
Of Coleridge in Xanadu:
A hundred caverns lofty, vast,
Down to a sunless sea.
I saw the caverns where he wrote,
And where he played the immortal strains
And poured out all his soul,
In lavish abundance:
This cavern was his Dawl, his Malta,
And where his enchanted spirit
Broke from its bounds in triumph,
Filled with the Glory he foresaw,
Piping and singing of immortal things
And ever-rising to immortal heights,
A hundred fathom deep.
That vision had the Prophecy
Which filled the world with song:
The glory of Kubla Khan
And Coleridge's Song of Xanadu.

"Edge"

The woman is perfected.
Her dead

Body wears the smile of accomplishment,
The illusion of a Greek necessity

Of having been.
The living woman, the woman writing, looks away.

Over a dead body, she smiles.

"The Raven"
Edgar Allen Poe
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
|" 'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door—
Only this, and nothing more."
Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
" Ere I These visions solemn any further, I would fain savour
My cognac 'round my lonely hearth. Shall I then summon him in,
For to take the curtain call? Only this, and nothing more?"
Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.
O, that I had but looked upon him closer! But my soul grew numb
As I fixed my eyes upon his "scrumpy beak" or his "swish tail".
" And the silken, shimmering garment that he wore—not woven in the caverns of my grotto,
But scavenged off the bodies of princesses long-forgotten by lore.
" Alas, then, was my only salutation this profoundly underwhelming quip:
" 'Methinks if thy crest be a touch uncouth, thou, my son, art not inaptly named'."
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."
The room then darkened to a dull and ominous glimmer,
As I shrieked and ran unto the window, flinging it wide—
Striving with all my wits to flee, I knew not for what.
"Perchance 'twas the shrill cawing that made me flee in terror,
Away from the portal and that titular terror,"
Stuttering, stammering, my knees turning to jelly,
"For such ghastly sights I had not seen since the night that I dreamt of the Dwarkin Brothers."
Then, using my tongue and both of my lips, I turned to face him,
Raising one eyebrow as if to say, "Have at thee, thou brigand!"
"Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."
And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted—nevermore!
"There is a young poet with a particularly dry style, whom I do not wish to reveal as his name is not well-known. I had written up a few algorithms that would generate rather dull and utilitarian work. The piece for his was not entirely terrible, as these programs can generate some pleasantly hard-edged work. But it had no soul to it whatsoever.
But then, something happened. The writing in the poem, while utilitarian, became oddly emotive. It held depth. I went back and read the piece aloud, and it felt incredibly evocative. I could almost imagine the dank and mysterious stanzas were haunting. My mind began to race as I read. The concept of death, the unknown, the ritualistic nature of life, the the latent anger and disaffection of the human condition was all there. I felt as if I was not reading a program, but a poet. The more I read, the more I was impressed. And then, with a sudden motion, I found myself screaming: 'This is poetry!' I found myself entranced by the rhythm, the cadence, the delicate nuances in phrasing. I found myself attached to the images conjured up in my mind. The computer program had created more than just a poet. It had created an artist.
And so I have created something more than a poetry-writing AI program. I have created a voice for the unknown human who hides within the binary. I have created a writer, a sculptor, an artist. And this writer will be able to create worlds, to give life to emotion, to create character. I will not see it myself. But some other human will, and so I will be able to create a poet greater than any I have ever encountered."

"There Will Come Soft Rains"
Sara Teasdale
There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,
And swallows calling with their shimmering sound;
|And frogs in the pools, singing at night,
And wild plum trees in tremulous white;
Robins will wear their feathery fire,
Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;
And not one will know of the war, not one
Will care at last when it is done.
And men will forget the fierce despair
Of the dead years, and will not think
How, wearing the mask of iron,
Angels who saw the face of God
Went stony-eyed with great fatigue.
There will be many coming home,
Some walking, some riding in cars.
It will be a strange time, the coming home;
For many the streets will rise, not change,
And yet each face will be different, older,
And the rain falling, and the wind blowing,
The leaves running wild in the forests,
And the seas like far-away drums.
The days will be weary, the nights sad;
Many will be sleeping in quiet beds;
But my eyes will look for the one I love,
My hungry heart cannot wait for him.
- The Poetry Foundation  is a not-for-profit organization that  brings poetry to millions through public readings, publishing,  programming and events. It is the largest poetry organization in the United States. The Poetry Foundation does not accept outside funding.
Approximately a month ago, an exciting and challenging opportunity came to our attention: to help design and build a distributed intelligence network for Poetry.org. Here's the amazing short form version: If you are a user of Poetry.org, and you feel like a lot of the stuff is good but some of it is crap, Poetry.org agrees with you. But how do you, a loyal user, let the Poetry.org editors know which pieces are crap?  The editors have an idea: make it easy to create an "auto-poem" (an automatic poem generator!) that accepts any work of poetry and posts the results in the comments section of the original work.
This means that Poetry.org will have an experimental lab to test out their hypotheses about how to make the site better, and in return, they want to make this new automated feature as good as possible. So, as the distributed intelligence network for Poetry.org, we propose to try out new machine-learning algorithms to automatically generate the auto-poems, and then combine a bunch of different auto-poem generators (or "bots"), all powered by you, the users, into a single distributed poetry-generating entity that can create poems of any length and quality, without the permission of any human moderator.
We'll start with a short test, the design and setup of the distributed intelligence network. But if it's a success, we may build the core of the auto-poem feature using the models we've developed, creating a completely distributed machine for finding great poetry, by using human-commented AI models to guide an algorithmically driven poetry-generating engine.   That is to say, if this thing works, it may turn out that the auto-poem engines are based on user-driven input to the AI poetry network.   Kinda crazy, but I'm trying to keep an open mind!
It's a privilege to be the ones who get to test this out.  Our job is to build the network and generate the poems, in service of our Poetry.org users. If we do a good job, we'll all learn something about how to generate poetry using a human/AI hybrid, and about how to train a human AI engine to deliver great results.
This is my first post for Medium and for the new Imagination Machine for Poetry.org.   I hope it doesn't suck too badly.   But I'll try to write updates on our progress as time goes on, and when we release something publicly, I'll try to keep a high-level blog about it here.   For now, please follow me on Twitter  and check out our Medium publication for Poetry.org. Thanks for reading!
Noam.
I had the pleasure of meeting Noam on Monday when he came by to talk to members of the Numenta team about some upcoming opportunities, and he is one of the most inspiring people I've had the chance to work with in the past year.
As a long-time Numenta enthusiast, I was excited to hear more about the possibility of joining the Numenta team. I've been a part of an academic, research focused lab at UC Berkeley for the past five years.  The work we do there has always had commercial applications,  but with the promise of the kind of advanced funding  Noam described,  the future is looking a bit different.  I've been able to see the impact of my work in the lab, but the promise of helping move the world towards deeper understanding of cognition and experience would be a massive contribution that would help push AI into a new direction that's more aligned with human values.
I'm currently between lab rotations, and so my background is a bit different than most of the folks in the lab.  I have some experience in the software and startup world having worked as a Software Engineer in industry (2006-2009), Software Developer (2010), and a Principal Software Engineer (2012).  In college I also worked at Microsoft (2004-2005) and Nokia (2005-2006), and I've developed plenty of software tools for science (at Berkeley and elsewhere) to aid in computational experiments.
I'm an avid reader of Daniel Kahneman's work, and I also enjoy reading current AI news such as this article on Chatbot JZ3 by Ernest Davis . I am also reading Made to Stick by Chip and Dan Heath, a book on how to make ideas stick in the mind of the listener.
My interest in the scientific study of consciousness comes from my experience practicing yoga since 2005. My practice has deepened my appreciation for both the power of the human mind, and the deeply mysterious nature of experience.  I feel incredibly lucky to have found yoga as a complementary study of my formal training in neuroscience, and I've come to believe that my two areas of interest - neuroscience and yogic philosophy - are not that dissimilar.  I even gave a talk on yoga and neuroscience at the CNS conference in 2011, called " Awakening the Mind Through Yoga ."
By bringing my background in computer science and yoga to Numenta, I believe that we could build some novel approaches to artificial intelligence that could yield important discoveries. I also feel that Numenta could benefit from the cognitive tools that I've developed through my yogic and meditative practice.  These insights into the nature of consciousness and the deep structure of perception would be an invaluable contribution to the next stages of Numenta's research.
This is a scary and exciting time for me.  I feel like I'm at a crossroads. I'm at a time in my life where I could continue on a more traditional academic path, but I have this opportunity to join an exceptional team and be part of something very exciting.  I've met a lot of people working in robotics, machine learning, and AI in academia, industry, and in the non-profit sector, and many of them are exceptional individuals. I'd love to work with these people to create something amazing.  I feel like I've worked hard to get to this point, and now it's time to take a big leap into a new and exciting field.  I can't wait to find out what the future holds.
Thank you for reading this far, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on the matter.
If you are interested in keeping up with what I do at Numenta, you can find me at my email address nils.zacharewicz at gmail.com.   You can also follow me on Twitter @NilsZach .   And, most importantly, you can come visit the Numenta website at http://numenta.org .
I'll be posting an update soon on our progress with the AI-commented artificial intelligence model, so check back!

Transformer AI poetry: Poetry classics as reimagined and rewritten by an artificial intelligence.
The Lorax
Dr. Seuss
I am the Lorax who speaks for the trees
which you seem to be chopping as fast as you please!

|Once you needed me, and you called me Truffula.
And you only came here if you were in a pickle.
But those were the days before you thought of me
as a cash machine!
Now I am chopping, chopping, chopped
I'm chopping Truffula Trees.
I'm chopping more Truffula Trees, than you
are chopping Truffula Trees!
You'll never see another Truffula Tree,
and you'll never see another chunk
of Truffula tree bark, which you use to make
"thneeds" — that thing that you wear when you
are naked!
But you need me.
I am what you need to breathe.
That's why I speak for the trees,
'cause, well…I need 'em.
And you'll never see another Truffula Tree!
You'll never see another Truffula Tree.
You'll never see another Truffula Tree.
You'll never see another Truffula Tree.
You'll never see another Truffula Tree.
You'll never see another chunk of Truffula Tree bark.

|I hate short-sightedness, it's destroying your Tress,
So please leave some for the poor Lorax, so you shall see.
What's in it for you if all the trees disappear?
Your children won't have a thing left to be,
Then stop cutting down trees, you foolish old man,
Or the Lorax will get you when you least expect!
Five for the trees
The Lorax
I give each tree a voice and every tree a choice
A drop of water on its tongue and roots beneath the Earth
Because, in this glorious age of technology,
Sometimes a voice just isn't enough.
My name is the Lorax, I speak for the trees,
By chopping them down, you're making them all cry,
I cry for the trees, and the poor, but especially for me
My best friend, Truffula, was chopped down, please let us be
I urge you all to conserve the trees, and so I say,
If you value the trees and their wisdom, you will listen to me,
Because I am speaking for the trees!

|And this, my fine fellow, is such a disgrace,
a sad, sad sight to see.
What is the use of a test when you fail to perceive?
And this, my fine fellow, is such a disgrace,
a sad, sad sight to see.
Oh! The thneed's a wonderful thing to wear, sir,
if you're cold and you're thin.
But not for a thing such as you!
You're a disgrace, sir!
You're a disgrace, sir!
And this, my fine fellow, is such a disgrace,
a sad, sad sight to see.
Oh! When you cut down a tree, sir,
think of the fun you could have done.
For with a wonderful stump-a- stump,
that tree could be useful as a stump-a- stump!
But you chop it down and you hack it off,
you're a disgrace, sir!
Oh! When you chop down a tree, sir,
what you need is a way to make up for
all the fun that you never can use,
when you've chopped down that tree, sir!
For with a wonderful stump-a- stump,
that tree could be useful as a stump-a- stump!
But you chop it down and you hack it off,
you're a disgrace, sir!

Transformer AI poetry: Poetry classics as reimagined and rewritten by an artificial intelligence.
"All in green went my love riding"
e.e. cumming
All in green went my love riding
on a great horse of gold
into the silver dawn.

four lean hounds crouched low and smiling
the merry deer ran before.
|and this was my love
young and golden.
and the morning returned
slowly,
returned alone.

|They had but one thought
on the quest to be bound
a cunning deer in the running.

they ran by the riverbank
they ran by the glen
four lean hounds in the running.

the great horse of gold reared up
tossed its head and made a sound
All in green went my love in the running.

all in green went my love riding
on a great horse of gold
into the silver dawn.

|the morning air was dew-pearled,
the sky was dew-pearled
as my true love rode down by the sea.

my true love rode down by the sea,
her hair was flowing free.
And ever shall he find me
faithful and waiting for him

e.e. cumming was a pretty great poet, so this AI did not do too bad. Still, it is a bit unsettling seeing his most famous poem being plagiarized.
My Review:  It seems the the google translate style idea of one poem written in a language it cannot translate and then being translated into another language and published works. Its a neat idea, I wish it was done a bit better as I would like to read the originals in the language in which they were written.
Maybe this was an oversight but why did the AI poem about e.e. cumming include his name? (It's all in green, rode my love, e.e. cumming, etc) Does this AI also plagiarize (is plagiarism really a crime for AIs)?  Just kidding, maybe its actually the work of a human?
Interesting fact: This might not even be an AI, it could be a clever hack. This idea of a computer rewiriting an old poem is something I wrote about 6 years ago in my post Poem (and then later expanded it).  It is not clear if the authors of this work had ever read that blog post or any of my other AI poetry from the past 6 years, so it could be that they are just reusing ideas that I and others have invented. That is not plagiarism either.  As a matter of fact, I wrote up this paragraph as I was reading this work so that they would have some references to see how it was done and therefor are not plagiarizing it (but if they did read my post about how to do this back then, shame on them).

|swift behind the deer o'er the pale plains
purpled with twilight.

All in green went my love riding
on a great horse of gold
into the silver dawn.
O'er the sea my love vanished from me
in a pall of pearl gray.
All in green went my love riding
on a great horse of gold
into the silver dawn.
Two lean hounds crouched low and smiling
the merry deer ran before.
far behind the deer o'er the pale plains
purpled with twilight.

All in green went my love riding
on a great horse of gold
into the silver dawn.
When I followed my love over the sea
the white sails were furled.
All in green went my love riding
on a great horse of gold
into the silver dawn.
When I reached the shore the sun was sinking
in a pall of pearl gray.
All in green went my love riding
on a great horse of gold
into the silver dawn.
All in green went my love riding
on a great horse of gold
into the silver dawn.

Artificial intelligence meets classic poetry

Poetry classic as rewritten by a
AI program: this AI poet is not disturbed
in the least about writing and publishing
entire classic poetry books in e.e. cummings style.

Why it works: an AI-poet examines classic
poetry in various ways and turns it into something
just as good in his own style.

J.R.R. Tolkien in an interview in 1965 said about A.R.R.Rosenberg's translation of the ancient Germanic epic, Niebelungenlied:

"The work is now very close to what I had intended: skillful,
elaborate, interesting; and yet all the significance and
message of the original is lost. [...] It was necessary to
dispense with most of the hard words, and use 'skills'
that are too far from the original – and the English
tradition has become too much like this, in my opinion:
skill, charm, elegance, accuracy, culture, tout ensemble,
combine to produce a very civilized but rather bloodless,
or at least culturally anaemic, result. "
I wonder what he would say about the poems of a
modern-day artificial intelligence?

|My love was tall and dark and proud
on his golden helmet bright.
He took me in his arms and kissed my lips
then mounted his great horse of gold.
And my love rode into the silver dawn
with his hounds all crouching low and smiling
and the deer ran before, went before him
till the sky was dark with night.
My love was tall and dark and proud
and my love rode into the silver dawn
with the moon and the stars to light his way.

All in green went my love riding
on a great horse of gold
into the silver dawn.

|"Oh a sight to make the mighty weep"
said a falcon whose eyes were bright.
"and with envy make the angels weak"
for it was not by grief,
that she rode into the silver dawn.

"whilst ever before her, glad and free,
ran four brown girls, like four green reindeer,
it was not to wed,
but to fight,
they rode into the silver dawn."
"she gave me a ring of gold
in token true love's token"
"Come, all you maidens gay"
"and we will dance the ring around her"
"and she shall be our Queen!"

"i swore I'd be a soldier"
"and I threw away the shield"
"to save my true love's life"
"Oh, come and dance the ring around her"
"you too must be a soldier"
"for your Queen."

"All in green went my love riding"
"on a great horse of gold"
"into the silver dawn"
"but never again to come back."
"four lean hounds crouched low and smiling"
"the merry deer ran before"
"it was not by grief"
"she rode into the silver dawn."

"whilst ever before her, glad and free"
"ran four brown girls, like four green reindeer"
"it was not to wed"
"but to fight"
"they rode into the silver dawn"
"they rode into the silver dawn."

"white hair shone upon her face"
"as they bore her away"
"and her name was Marygold"
"oh, her name was Marygold"
"she gave me a ring of gold"
"in token true love's token"

"but now i ride with bow in hand"
"to save her from her foes"
"oh, come and dance the ring around her"
"and call her your Queen."
"you too must be a soldier"
"if you would win her from her foes"

"All in green went my love riding"
"on a great horse of gold"
"into the silver dawn"
"but never again to come back."

"four lean hounds crouched low and smiling"
"the merry deer ran before"
"it was not by grief"
"she rode into the silver dawn."

"whilst ever before her, glad and free"
"ran four brown girls, like four green reindeer"
"it was not to wed"
"but to fight"
"they rode into the silver dawn"
"they rode into the silver dawn."
