Who trusted God was love indeed
And love Creation’s final law
Tho’ Nature, red in tooth and claw
With ravine, shriek’d against his creed.
The hills are shadows, and they flow
From form to form, and nothing stands;T
hey melt like mist, the solid lands,
Like clouds they shape themselves and go.
Where are the stars? The mighty sun?

+ Of space—and time—and matter—where?
+ What mightier hand than God’s could fling
+ The stars around the sky like sand?
+ Whose throes convuls’d the deepest sea,
+ And bade the abyss its secrets roar?`
+ If Nature’s laws the stars control,
+ Then God is less than Nature’s soul.

## Storytelling

```diff
The following is a story about Animal Crossing characters Kidd the Goat and Gala the Pig and Beardo the Bear where they are competing in a bug-catching contest. Kidd is a lazy goat villager. Gala is a normal pig villager. Beardo is a smug bear villager.
 
One day, Kidd, Gala, and Beardo were in the tent of Redd's place in front of the Wishing Well. They were watching Bugsy the Butterfly, as he was telling his story about how he got his own show called Bugsy's Picture Show. Kidd and Gala were listening to Bugsy as he was telling his story about his days as a superhero named Bug Man.
 
After Bugsy's Picture Show, Kidd told Beardo and Gala that he has always been collecting bugs since his days as an islander, but he hasn't been catching many lately because he hasn't been having enough time to do so.
 
"Well you could always just borrow my net," Beardo said. "I'll give it to you."
 
"Oh thanks," Kidd said. "I'll use it when I catch some bugs."
 
The next day, Kidd woke up from his sleep and went outside to see if there were any bugs to catch. He saw many different types of insects, but there was one type that caught his eye: butterflies!
 
+ Kidd remembered what Bugsy said about butterflies being good friends with bears and kangaroos.

INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR’S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING

MACE arrives with THREE JEDI to arrest PALPATINE.

PALPATINE: Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I must say, you're here sooner than expected.

MACE WINDU: In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor.

MACE WINDU and the other JEDI ignite their lightsabers.

PALPATINE: Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?

MACE: The Senate will decide your fate.

PALPATINE: (burst of anger) I am the Senate!

MACE: Not yet!

PALPATINE stands, a laser sword appears out of his cloak sleeve, and he spins toward the JEDI.

PALPATINE: It's treason, then.

+ PALPATINE attacks the JEDI. DASH Rendar and LOADSOR start fighting and run to a control panel.

+ DASH: This switch opens the blast shield. Close it behind us, Loadsor.

+ LOADSOR: But... we'll be trapped.

+ Loadsor pushes the switch and they hide as the blast shield starts closing, just before PALPATINE reaches them.

+ 266 EXT. NABOO-MAIN CITY-HOUSETOP-DAWN

+ OBI-WAN waits and waits and waits. (It's a ANAKIN/SHMI moment)

+ OBI-WAN: Young Skywalker...

+ *sniff*

+ OBI-WAN: ...Where are you?

+ OBI-WAN hears something. He looks at the top of the tower down below.

+ 267 EXT. NABOO-MAIN CITY

+ ANAKIN almost jumps.

+ ANAKIN: Obi-Wan?

+ OBI-WAN: Finally! The boat is ready. I'll come down and meet you.

+ ANAKIN runs off the platform of the city's top level.

+ 268 EXT. NABOO-MAIN CITY-BEACH-DAWN

+ Anakin keeps running, when he runs into something soft. He looks up and sees Padme; he stops and smiles.

+ PADME: Look, it's not safe here. Let's just board the ship and leave.

+ ANAKIN: Yes, I've found a way to save you-

+ PADME: Don't say it. I don't want to hear it.

+ ANAKIN: Padme, I ran away from my own emotions. I'm not afraid to let them rule me again. (Getting on his knees) I am a Jedi, and I believe in purity of thought, but I can't deny my feelings for you.

+ Anakin gets up, and starts to walk towards Padme, but he crumples over in pain.

+ PADME: Anakin? What is it?

+ ANAKIN: I can't see... Everything is spinning.

+ PADME runs to get some water from the ocean. She rubs some on Anakin's forehead, and realizes what's happening.

+ PADME: No.
