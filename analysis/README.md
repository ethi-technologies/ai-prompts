### Arithmetic

#### Basic Addition

```
1+2= 2
40 plus 50 equals 90
```

```
120+209=329
980+40=1020
591+325=926
123+456=579
```

NB: For large numbers, the commas are essential, and sometime symbols e.g. $, â‚¬, or Â£ can help.

#### Larger Numbers

```
7,400,357 + 2,709,779 = 10,110,136
9,359,517 + 8,280,301 = 17,639,818
6,885,075 + 9,531,680 = 16,416,755
3,466,242 + 8,344,302 = 11,810,544

On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep
Where the foeâ€™s haughty host in dread silence reposes,

As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?

In full glory reflected now shines in the stream,

Oâ€™er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

## Summarisation

### **Summarize Stock Market Activity**

```diff
My second grader asked me what this passage means:

"""

Overnight trading for the NYSE Index futures was a bit volatile, 
dropping by about 3% to the downside before moving sharply back to the upside. 
Gold futures were unchanged and the E-mini NASDAQ 100 futures remained near 
unchanged. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond finished unchanged from its 
close of 2.45% earlier today.

"""

I rephrased it for him, in plain language a second grader can understand:

"""

The stock market dropped by a lot, then went back up.

"""

I rephrased it for him, in plain language a second grader can understand:

"""
+ The price of gold did not change. The NASDAQ 100 is a stock index. 
+ The NASDAQ 100 went up a little bit. The price of the 10-year Treasury bond 
+ did not change.

### **Summarize NDA**

My second grader asked me what this passage means:

"""

"""

I rephrased it for him, in plain language a second grader can understand:

"""
+ This means that if you tell anyone else something I told you in private, I can sue you and make you pay me lots of money. It also means that if I tell you something in private, I can sue you if you tell anyone else.
