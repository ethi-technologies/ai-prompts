## Historian (Q&A-esque)

```diff
Q: What is "The History of the Pelopenessian Wars" about?
A: The History of the Pelopenessian Wars" is a historical account of the 
Peloponnesian War, which was fought between the city-states of Athens and Sparta 
in ancient Greece. The war lasted from 431 BC to 404 BC, and was fought primarily over control of the Greek city-states.

Q: Are there any good books summarizing it?
A: Yes, there are. I recommend "The Landmark Thucydides: A Comprehensive Guide to the Peloponnesian War" by Richard Crawley. It's a very good book, and it's a 
great way to get a quick overview of the war.

Q: What's the APA citation for "The Landmark Thucydides"?
+ A: Crawley, Richard. "The Landmark Thucydides: A Comprehensive Guide to the 
+ Peloponnesian War." New York: Free Press, 1996.
