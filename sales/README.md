Dear Deloitte graduate recruitment,

I'm writing to apply to join your graduate scheme in Technology Consulting. I'm a competitive and driven second year Physics graduate from the University of Bristol and have a passion for technology and science that I've been fostering for the last five years.
+ 
+ I've had a number of jobs throughout my degree, from working in a building site to painting hotels as well as helping to organise Bristol's biggest career fairs. These have all helped me to understand what I want from my career, as well as teach me skills that I can apply to my career in technology consulting. I'm a qualified coach with a passion for encouraging people to achieve their potential and to deliver the best results possible.
+ 
+ I understand you're looking for technology consultants with a strong technical background who have skills that can be transferred to real-world challenges. As you can see from my attached CV, I have excellent analytical skills, which I developed through my degree and through my work experience, and I am a forward-thinker with a creative approach to problem solving.
+ 
+ As part of my university course, I've taken part in technology outreach sessions, allowing me to meet young people from schools, colleges and sixth forms and to promote careers in science, technology, engineering and maths. I've taken these sessions to under-represented groups, such as children with special needs, and I understand that they are a great way to show young people that STEM subjects are accessible to everyone, no matter what their academic background.
+ 
+ In my spare time, I'm a keen skier and tennis player and I also enjoy playing football. These activities have taught me excellent time management skills and I'm used to balancing different priorities. I know that in technology consulting you have to juggle a range of different projects and responsibilities, all while maintaining a demanding work-life balance.
+ 
+ I am a quick learner and a diligent worker, and I understand that in order to succeed, I have to demonstrate commitment, curiosity and a passion for technology. In the attached reference from my course leader at the University of Bristol, you can see how I always try to do my best and ask questions in order to learn as much as I can. I understand the importance of self-development and I can assure you that I will never stop learning.
+ 
+ I'm keen to join your technology consulting team because I know I would thrive in the challenging and fast-paced environment. I'd love the opportunity to learn from your expert consultants and to work with a team that is working on a diverse range of projects. I've heard great things about Deloitte and would love to find out more. I look forward to hearing from you.
+ 
+ Yours sincerely,
+ Ella Duffy

#### Programming Tweets

My favorite programming tweets:

"I asked @ilyasut how to set neural network init. He accidentally replied with a poem:
You want to be on the edge of chaos
Too small, and the init will be too stable, with vanishing gradients
Too large, and you'll be unstable, due to exploding gradients
You want to be on the edge"

"I've been programming for 10 years now. Still feels like magic out of a fantasy: say the words exactly right, and watch your intent get carried out; say the words slightly wrong, and things go haywire. Feeling of wonder and joy hasn't faded one bit."

"Web programming is the science of coming up with increasingly complicated ways of concatenating strings."

"If you ever feel alone in this world, read your firewall logs. Problem solved :)"

"Always wanted to travel back in time to try fighting a younger version of yourself? Software development is the career for you!"

"After 17 years as a professional developer, it seems that the answer to every programming question is "it depends""

+ "Software development is the only job where I have to update my r√©sum√© every day."
+ 
+ "Someday we'll find the contact-closure conditions that make compilers easier. But not today."
+ 
+ "What would happen if the underhanded spam algorithm contest only allowed submissions by honest programmers?"
+ 
+ "Any given technology is usually used in at least two competing non-obvious ways. At some point, the one which is used for communication becomes the dominant one."
+ 
+ "Someone decided to make some programming fonts as ugly as possible and they accidentally invented Unicode."
+ 
+ "Everyone who says "software is eating the world" should also say "software is terrible at digesting the world.""
+ 
+ "In my current project, my head hurts every time I look at the code and my heart aches every time I look at the interface."
+ 
+ "Programming is the ultimate interface challenge: we must ensure that our users feel only delight when using our creations."
+ 
+ "The dark secret of programming is that it's not done until the last user is dead."
+ 
+ "When you choose a programming language, you also choose a meme."
