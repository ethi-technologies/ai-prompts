## Social Media Generation

### üê¶Tweet Generation

#### Programming Tweets

**My favorite programming tweets:

"I asked @ilyasut how to set neural network init. He accidentally replied with a poem:
You want to be on the edge of chaos
Too small, and the init will be too stable, with vanishing gradients
Too large, and you'll be unstable, due to exploding gradients
You want to be on the edge"

"I've been programming for 10 years now. Still feels like magic out of a fantasy: say the words exactly right, and watch your intent get carried out; say the words slightly wrong, and things go haywire. Feeling of wonder and joy hasn't faded one bit."

"Web programming is the science of coming up with increasingly complicated ways of concatenating strings."

"If you ever feel alone in this world, read your firewall logs. Problem solved :)"

"Always wanted to travel back in time to try fighting a younger version of yourself? Software development is the career for you!"

"After 17 years as a professional developer, it seems that the answer to every programming question is "it depends""**
